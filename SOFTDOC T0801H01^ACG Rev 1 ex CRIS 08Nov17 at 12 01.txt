Additional Information:

    1. H06.07 is the minimum supported RVU. 
     
    2. If you need to start a custom SSH process with a different
    configuration than the default SSH processes, an individual CONFIG
    file should be created. It is also recommended to use separate
    SSHCTL and HOSTKEY files. Refer to the HP NonStop SSH Reference
    manual for additional information.
    
    3. As of H06.22/J06.11 (SPR T0801^AAS), a configuration file named
    SSHMCFG has been added for exclusive use by SSH2 processes $ZSSP0 
    and $ZSSP1 configured for the maintenance LANs. The original SSHCFG
    file can now be used for SSH2 processes configured for non-maintenance
    LANs, but keep in mind that this file will be overwritten with
    the installation of a new RVU. A backup should be kept in case changes
    have been made.
    
    The startup parameter for processes $ZSSP0 and $ZSSP1 has been
    modified in the ZSSHGP file for SPR T0801^AAS, and now points to
    configuration file SSHMCFG instead of SSHCFG in the ADD process
    section and a new ALTER process section.
    
    After a fallback to a pre-J06.11/H06.22 RVU or to an SPR prior to
    T0801^AAS, the $ZSSP0 and $ZSSP1 processes will not start because
    their startup parameter definition points to configuration file
    SSHMCFG which does not exist in pre-AAS NonStop SSH releases.
    The ZSSHGP file in earlier NonStop SSH releases does not
    contain an ALTER section, and the "process add" commands in the ADD
    section fail because the process definitions already exist. 
    To resolve this problem, issue these commands at a TACL prompt:
    
    SCF DELETE PROCESS $ZZKRN.#SSH-ZTCP*
    RUN ZMODGP $SYSTEM.ZSSH.ZSSHGP
    SCF START PROCESS $ZZKRN.#SSH-ZTCP*".
    
    4. NonStop SSH enables secure SSH sessions with the MR-Win6530 
    terminal emulator (product number T0819) on the NonStop 
    System Console (NSC).
    
    To create SSH sessions with MR-Win6530 on the NSC:
    a. Select "New Profile" from the "File" menu
    b. Select "6530 terminal" for a TACL session, "VT terminal" 
       for an OSS shell session, or "Transfer" for a file 
       transfer session.
    c. Select "Communication" from the "Options" menu
    d. In the "Options" dialog, select Secure Shell as interface
       and click the "OK" button.
    e. Select "Connect" from the "File" menu.
    f. In the Secure Shell parameters dialog, enter the IP 
       address of a default TCPIP stack ($ZTCP0 or $ZTCP1), a 
       Guardian user ID and password, and then click "OK".
    
    5. NonStop SSH is pre-installed on the default TCPIP stacks, 
    $ZTCP0 and $ZTCP1. To enable NonStop SSH on additional TCPIP 
    stacks:
    
    a. Create an SCF IN file with the SCF command
       ADD PROCESS $ZZKRN.#SSH-<tcpip-process-name>, &
       AUTORESTART 10, &
       CPU FIRSTOF (<nn>,<nn>,<nn>,<nn>), &
       DEFAULTVOL $SYSTEM.ZSSH, &
       HIGHPIN ON, &
       HOMETERM $ZHOME, &
       INFILE $ZHOME, &
       NAME $SSH<nn>, &
       OUTFILE $ZHOME, &
       PRIORITY 150, &
       PROGRAM $SYSTEM.ZSSH.SSH2, &
       SAVEABEND OFF, &
       STARTMODE APPLICATION, &
       STARTUPMSG &
       "ALL; SUBNET $<tcpip-process-name> CONFIG $SYSTEM.ZSSH.SSHCFG", &
       STOPMODE STANDARD, &
       TYPE OTHER, &
       USERID SUPER.SUPER
    
    where
    
    <tcpip-process-name> is name of the TCPIP stack SSH is enabled on
    <nn> is a two digit CPU number.
    
    b. Start SCF at the TACL prompt and issue the commands
    
    OBEY <scf-in-file>
    START $ZZKRN.#SSH-<tcpip-process-name>
        
    where
    <scf-in-file> is the name of the SCF IN file you have created.
    
    Note: There are many considerations when installing HP NonStop SSH.
    For detailed information, please refer to the appropriate manuals,
    for instance the HP NonStop SSH Reference Manual as well as the 
    TCP/IP management and configuration Manuals.
    
    6. In June, 2011, HP started to offer an SFTP API product which
    requires a special license. It enables users to easily convert
    existing FTP scripts/programs to switch over to SFTP. The 
    minimum SPR supporting this feature is T0801^AAQ for H/J series,
    and T0801^AAT for G-series. The HP NonStop SFTP API Reference
    Manual, part number 659755-nnn, describes the API in detail.
    Support for it is built into the SFTP client which must be
    placed together with the license into a dedicated subvolume.
    Currently it is not possible to use the SSH home subvolume 
    $system.zssh because of conflicts in the license naming and
    license checking. To simplify the installation process, starting
    with TCF T0801^AAY (H/J series) and T0801^AAZ (G-series), the
    SFTP client will be distributed in $system.sysnn (as before)
    and in $system.zsftpapi. The user needs to place the SFTPAPI
    license (named "LICENSE") into the $system.zsftpapi subvolume
    where the additional copy of the sftp object is located. In the
    program that makes the FTP API calls, the variable FTPPGM
    pointing to the FTP client must be modified to point to the SFTP
    client $system.zsftpapi.sftp.
    
    7. In February 2015 HP released a version of NonStop SSH compatible 
    with the new NonStop X or L-series systems.  The SPR provided to 
    support the new hardware was T0801L02. 
    
    8. In September 2015 HP started to offer an SSH API library, 
    initially on H/J series, which requires a special license. 
    It enables users to control an SSH client programmatically.
    The minimum SPR supporting this feature is T0801^ABG for H/J series.
    The HP NonStop cf SSH-Lib Reference Manual, part number 
    839768-001, describes the API in detail.
    The requisite files will be released in subvolume $SYSTEM.ZSSHAPI.
    It is not possible to use the SSH home subvolume $system.zssh 
    because of conflicts in the license naming and license checking.
    Details on licensing the SSH library will be provided separately.
    
    Support for the SSH API on L-series systems became available in 
    March 2016.

Installation Considerations:

    Minimal system impact

Installation Instructions:

    * If a system load was NOT performed:
          1. Invoke the INSTALL^TEMPLATES TACL macro to install this 
             SPR's EMS template file(s) in the running system.  The macro 
             can be found in $<ISVvol>.ZINSAIDS.TACLMACS or Support Note 
             S92067B. For instructions, LOAD the macro and type: 
             INSTALL^TEMPLATES /OUT <outdev>/ HELP 
    
          2. Issue the following commands in SCF: 
             START PROCESS $ZZKRN.#SSH*
    
    * Note:  Before stopping SSH/STN processes always verify in advance 
             that there is at least one method that will allow continued 
             access to the system.
    
    Migration Considerations
    
    When migrating from one NSK system to another, the original 
    configuration can be preserved by porting the SSHCTL database,
    the HOSTKEY file, and the SSH configuration file to the SSH subvolume
    $system.zssh. The migration should only be done for SSH2 processes
    associated with non-maintenance LANs. Note that the configuration
    file SSHCFG is a template and will be overwritten by DSM/SCM when
    a new SPR is installed. Therefore, the ported configuration file
    should be named differently, and the startup message in the SCF
    input file for persistent processes (or the startup obey file) 
    changed to point to the correct configuration file. Also take note
    that if a license file existed in the original configuration,
    but not required any longer in the target system (SPRs >= T0801^AAS),
    the customer name from the license file must be placed as a value
    for parameter CUSTOMER in the configuration file.

New Features:

 1. [H01^ACG] 
    Added audit message for outgoing connections. Modified the log 
    level for an existing log message related to a successful 
    establishment of an outgoing connection.
    (No SOLN)
   
 2. [H01^ACG] 
    Enhanced PAUTH code base by avoiding the read of multiple lines 
    from the RLSEID file, because this file is a one line file. 
    Use case is where an OS upgrade caused a change of the RLSEID 
    file causing PAUTH to go into a loop trying to read multiple 
    lines from this file.
    (No SOLN)
   
 3. [H01^ACG] 
    RESTRICTION-PROFILE related enhancements have been added:
    1. Support option to define RESTRICTION-PROFILE attributes 
       CONNECT-TO, PERMIT-LISTEN and PERMIT-OPEN as blacklist instead
       of whitelist. This can be achieved by prefixing the attribute
       value with a tilde (character '~').
       Example:
       ALTER RESTRICTION-PROFILE rp1, CONNECT-TO 
       ~(192.168.37.0:[0-65535], 192.168.37.1:[0-65535])
                                                     
    2. Allow specifying more than one RESTRICTION-PROFILE per USER. 
       If more than one name is specified in an SSHCOM command, then
       it must be enclosed in parentheses.
       Example:
       ALTER USER usr1, RESTRICTION-PROFILE (restr1, restr2)
    
       This enables a flexible grouping of connection restrictions in
       different RESTRICTION-PROFILE records. If whitelist entries 
       are configured, then at least one must match to grant 
       permission for an action (i.e. the whitelist entries are 
       ORed). If blacklist entries exist, then none must match, 
       i.e. the blacklist entries are ANDed.
       Permission is granted for a configuration with whitelist and 
       blacklist entries if a whitelist entry matches and none of 
       the blacklist entries match.
         
    3. Added support for a global restriction profile, via SSH2 
       parameter RESTRICTIONPROFILE, which is checked in addition to
       the per USER RESTRICTION-PROFILE configuration. Users can be 
       excluded from the processing of the global RESTRICTIONPROFILE 
       processing by configuring excluded users (SSH USER names as 
       well as SYSTEM-USER values) and excluded groups (Guardian 
       primary groups) via SSH2 parameters 
       RESTRICTIONPROFILEEXCLUDEUSERS and
       RESTRICTIONPROFILEEXCLUDEGROUPS, respectively.
     
    4. The SSHCOM command TEST RESTRICTION-PROFILE has been enhanced 
       to support a list of RESTRICTION-PROFILE names as well as new 
       options DETAIL (providing a more detailed explanation for a 
       restriction check), SELECT (allowing specification of a 
       sub-set of RESTRICTION-PROFILE attributes that are checked) 
       and SUPPRESS-GLOBAL-RESTRICTION-PROFILE, a flag that prevents
       considering the global SSH2 parameter RESTRICTIONPROFILE when
       the TEST RESTRICTION-PROFILE command is processed.
    (No SOLN)
   
 4. [H01^ACG] 
    For LOGMAXFILELENGTH and AUDITMAXFILELENGTH parameters, the new 
    maximum in KB is 524288, i.e. 512*1024; the maximum size of log 
    and audit files in bytes is now 536870912, i.e. 512*1024*1024.
    The default value was not changed and is 20000, as before.
    (No SOLN)
   
 5. [H01^ACG] 
    Added SSHCOM INFO SSH2 SUBSET name 'CONFIGURED' that allows just 
    the explicitly configured SSH2 parameters to be displayed, 
    no others.
    (No SOLN)
   
 6. [H01^ACG] 
    Using new SSH2 parameters LOGFILEEXTENTSIZE and 
    AUDITFILEEXTENTSIZE, it is now possible to configure the extent 
    size for log and audit messages.
    The default value is 28 (pages), which is the previously fixed 
    value for the extent size of log and audit files. The values for 
    the extent sizes can be changed dynamically via the SSHCOM SET 
    LOGFILEEXTENTSIZE and SET AUDITFILEEXTENTSIZE commands. 
    The new values will be used for the next log/audit file that is 
    newly created (which can be forced using the
    SSHCOM commands ROLLOVER LOGFILE and ROLLOVER AUDITFILE).
    (No SOLN)
   
 7. [H01^ACG] 
    Added the connection details of the TCP/IP connection from the 
    local host to a telnet server process to the PTY allocate audit 
    message as well as to the STATUS CHANNEL DETAIL output. 
    Such a connection is established if SSH USER attributes 
    CI-PROGRAM/SHELL-PROGRAM are configured with "telnet"
    or "telnet <host> [<port>]".
    (SOLN 10-161205-4287)
   
 8. [H01^ACD] 
    Added support for RSA key generation of 3072 bit and 4096 bit key
    lengths. 
    The same support is added for HOSTKEY creation/generation of RSA 
    keys during SSH2 startup.
    (SOLN 10-150303-7466)
   
 9. [H01^ACD] 
    Added support for key exchange algorithm
    diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 which can be set with SSH2 
    parameter ALLOWEDKEYEXCHANGEALGORITHMS.
    (No SOLN)
   
10. [H01^ACD] 
    For better security the default algorithm type for HOSTKEY has
    been changed from DSA to RSA and the default key size is now 
    2048.
    Before the change the default algorithm type was DSA and the key 
    size was 1024 bits. 
    Existing HOSTKEY files do not get modified, i.e. a new host key
    using this new default is generated only if the HOSTKEY file gets
    removed.
    (No SOLN)
   
11. [H01^ACD] 
    The SSH2 process now checks for the existence of the Security
    Manager Process (SMP) after the startup of the SSH2 process.
    Previously the SSH2 process checked this once at startup only,
    which could cause problems if the SMP finished its startup after 
    the SSH2 process tried to open the SMP for SPI communication. 
    In this case specific Safeguard information was not available for
    SSH2 processing (e.g. frozen state of a Safeguard user or 
    OBJECTTYPE USER configuration).
    (No SOLN)
   
12. [H01^ACD] 
    Added support for converting the SSH database and the SSH private
    host key file from using one CUSTOMER value for encryption to a
    different CUSTOMER value. The conversion is triggered by starting
    an SSH2 process with a new run-mode called CONVERTDB with already
    existing SSH2 parameter CUSTOMER and a new parameter called 
    NEWCUSTOMER. In case multiple SSH databases need to be converted 
    as preparation of a database merge, then the conversion of the 
    private host key can be suppressed in subsequent CONVERTDB runs 
    by setting new SSH2 parameter SUPPRESSHOSTKEYCONVERSION with 
    value TRUE (default value is FALSE). The suppression is helpful
    because multiple SSH databases can be merged (via FUP COPY) but
    only one HOSTKEY can be used and only the one used in the future 
    must be converted to use the NEWCUSTOMER value for encryption.
    Example command (assuming default values for SSHCTL and HOSTKEY):
    RUN SSH2 CONVERTDB; CUSTOMER "current value"; NEWCUSTOMER
    "future value"
    
    For further details, please see the SSH Reference Manual.
    (SOLN 10-140325-7950)
   
13. [H01^ACD] 
    The SSH2 process now checks the priority of PTY server processes 
    and logs a message if the priority of that process is not equal 
    to the priority of the SSH2 process. This serves as a warning for
    the administrator to ensure the priority of PTY server processes 
    and SSH2 processes communicating with them are equal.
    (SOLN 10-160524-0231)
   
14. [H01^ACD] 
    Added parameter CLIENTALLOWEDSUBSYSTEMS, allowing outgoing
    connections listed in this parameter to be supplied as a single 
    value or a comma separated list.
    
    Default value is 'sftp,tacl,ci'.
    
    Note: Only channel requests for SUBSYSTEM are checked/restricted 
    by using this parameter. Channel requests for SHELL or EXEC are 
    neither checked nor restricted by this parameter. 
    (Using the SSH -N option does not require a SHELL and issues a 
    channel request of NOSHELL that is also not checked or restricted
    by this parameter.)
    (No SOLN)
   
15. [H01^ACD] 
    Added parameter CLIENTCIPHERS for setting the cipher algorithms
    a local client is allowed to specify via the -oCIPHERS option.
    The default value is the value of SSH2 parameter CIPHERS, which
    is used for controlling allowed cipher algorithms for incoming
    connections.
    (No SOLN)
   
16. [H01^ACD] 
    Added parameter CLIENTMACS for setting the MAC algorithms a local
    client is allowed to specify via the -oMACS option.
    The default value is the value of SSH2 parameter MACS, which is
    used for controlling allowed MAC algorithms for incoming 
    connections.
    (No SOLN)
   
17. [H01^ACD] 
    Added parameter MAXAUTHTRIES that specifies the maximum number of
    authentication attempts permitted per connection for the
    configured server parameter ALLOWEDAUTHENTICATIONS or SSH2 user 
    setting for parameter ALLOWED-AUTHENTICATIONS.
    The default value for this parameter is -1 which means no
    restriction to authentication attempts. Any other negative 
    configured values used will be treated as the default value of 
    -1.
    
    The maximum number of authentication attempts is 60. Any value
    configured greater than 60 will be treated as 60.
    (No SOLN)
   
18. [H01^ACD] 
    The priority for new user processes that the SSH2 process starts 
    is now restricted to have a maximum value of the priority of the 
    SSH2 process minus one.
    Before this change, new user processes were started with the
    priority of the SSH2 process if not configured otherwise (USER 
    attributes PRIORITY and SFTP-PRIORITY).
    (No SOLN)
   
19. [H01^ACD] 
    The existing functionality that allows hiding the fact that a
    specific user name exists (related to SSH2 parameter
    DISCONNECTIFUSERUNKNOWN) has been enhanced for the following 
    cases:
    - The SSH USER corresponding to the external ssh user name is
    frozen,
    - The system user configured via SYSTEM-USER via an SSH USER
    record no longer exists,
    - The system user configured via SYSTEM-USER via an SSH USER
    record is frozen,
    - Restriction profile checks that are configured for an SSH
    USER via attribute RESTRICTION-PROFILE fails,
    - Adding a new USER entry automatically fails (if parameter
    AUTOADDSYSTEMUSERS is set to TRUE).
    
    If parameter DISCONNECTIFUSERUNKNOWN is set to FALSE, there is no
    immediate disconnect of a new session in the above cases, in
    addition to the previously supported cases:
    - The SSH USER corresponding to the external ssh user name does
    not exist and AUTOADDSYSTEMUSERS is set to FALSE
    - The SSH USER corresponding to the external ssh user name does
    not exist and AUTOADDSYSTEMUSERS is set to TRUE but a 
    corresponding system user does not exist.
    (No SOLN)
   
20. [H01^ACD] 
    Log messages like "Cannot forward data because remote side has
    closed the channel, ignoring data" did not contain a session 
    identifier, making it hard to find the related session.
    Now the above log message and others contain the session log id
    (colon separated list of remote IP address, remote port and 
    local IP address).
    (No SOLN)
   
21. [H01^ACA] 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): IPRANGE related commands are now rejected.  
    The IPRANGE feature only works for telnet (LISTENER) sessions.
    (No SOLN)
   
22. [H01^ACA] 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): The existing STIX counter "ws not plain" has 
    been retitled to "53 ws not plain".
    (No SOLN)
   
23. [H01^ACA] 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): Service names now allow, in addition to alpha 
    and numeric characters, any special characters after the first 
    character except for:
    
            * ? . , ; ! ) ' "
    
    This change makes STN service names compatible with TELSERV
    except for "!" which has other uses in STNCOM. However for
    clarity it is recommended that use of special characters be
    minimized. The first character must still be alphabetic, and
    all alpha characters are upshifted.
    (No SOLN)
   
24. [H01^ACA] 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): A new command BREAK_IGNORE_NBO causes STN to 
    ignore a BREAK signal received when there is no application 
    owner of BREAK.
    
        BREAK_IGNORE_NBO      Y | N
    
            BREAK_IGNORE_NBO controls handling of break received
            from the terminal when there is no application owner
            of BREAK.
    
            BREAK_IGNORE_NBO Y ignores the break. STIX counter
            IGNORE BREAK NBO is incremented.
    
            BREAK_IGNORE_NBO N terminates the session with an STN60
            message.  STIX counter STN60 is incremented. 
            N is the default for compatibility with releases prior 
            to STN version B32.

    STN (pseudo-TTY): A new LISTOPENS command option was created to 
    restrict results to a specified window or to a range of opens:
    
        LISTOPENS [<window-name> | <n> | <n>-<n>]
    
    If the parameter is omitted, then all opens are listed.  If
    #window-name is specified, only opens for that window are listed.
    Normal window names as well as special names may be used:
    
        LISTOPENS #ZWN0023          typical dynamic window
        LISTOPENS #WIRE09           typical static window
        LISTOPENS #COMMAND.COMMAND  STNCOM openers
        LISTOPENS #SSH0             SSH processes
        LISTOPENS #ZSPI             SPI (SCF, NonStop ASAP)
    
      If a number or range of numbers is specified, then output
      is limited to the specified open table index or range of
      indices.  Example:

    STN (pseudo-TTY): A number of new STIX counters have been added 
    for ELP and other Resource Manager functions.  These may be 
    useful to help fine tune a large installation, especially when 
    third party CMON or SEEP products are used.  
    Please refer to the manual for more details.

30. [H01^ACA] 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): The new ELP_LOG_FILE command controls ELP log 
    entries.  This should only be used when requested by support 
    staff. The log contains details of all requests from STN to ELP,
    ELP's responses, and intermediate ELP steps authenticating users
    and launching processes.  This information is also captured in 
    STN traces, so ELP_LOG_FILE is rarely needed.
    
        ELP_LOG_FILE *NONE*
    
            The default - disables logging.
    
        ELP_LOG_FILE $vol.subvol.filename[@]
    
            A fully qualified filename, beginning with "$", 
            referring to a Spooler, a terminal, or an unstructured 
            disc file. An "@" after the filename is replaced with 
            the two digit RSCMGR index (see RSCMGR_DEPTH) to provide 
            a unique file name for each ELP. $0 and $ZHOME are not 
            allowed. The log data is formatted as lines of 
            displayable ASCII text.
            Passwords are not displayed.
    
            For disc files:  CRLF is added to each line. New data is
            appended to existing files.  If the file does not exist,
            STN will create it with code 180.  Disc files can be
            binary transferred to a PC for browsing or converted by
            CTOEDIT. Files are secured as "OOOO" and CLEARONPURGE.
        
            If ELP cannot open the file, logging is disabled, and
            the following message is displayed on $0:
    
                $Z3NA =STNELP_LOG_FILE \T.$BADLOG Open error= 14

31. [H01^ACA] 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): A new External Logon Process (ELP) feature has
    been added.
    
      STN has a Resource Manager (RSCMGR) to start applications for
      service types DYNAMIC, PATHWAY, and PATHWAYTERM. In previous 
      releases, the Resource Manager was entirely an internal part 
      of the STN program. The internal RSCMGR remains available as 
      the default, and ELP is now a configurable option for 
      USER_AUTHENTICATE_ and PROCESS_LAUNCH_ functions used to start
      Dynamic service applications.
    
      ELP operation is entirely automatic and transparent.  If an 
      error is encountered with ELP, STN automatically repeats the 
      request with the internal RSCMGR with no interruption of 
      service.
      PATHWAY or PATHWAYTERM services (which use SERVERCLASS_SEND_) 
      will continue to be handled by the internal RSCMGR.
    
      The new command ELP_OBJECT enables ELP:
    
        ELP_OBJECT  *NONE* | <filename>
    
        ELP_OBJECT *NONE*
    
          This is the default for compatibility with previous STN
          releases.  STN will use the internal resource manager
          (RSCMGR).
    
        ELP_OBJECT <filename>
    
          Specifies the ELP program object file using only the 
          filename (no node name, volume, or subvol). The ELP 
          program must be in the same subvol as the STN object file.
          When <filename> is specified, ELP is enabled and is 
          started by STN as needed.
    
      Each RSCMGR thread (default 3, range 1-25, see RSCMGR_DEPTH) 
      will have its own ELP process, which is started as needed.  
      Once started. an ELP process remains running and can handle 
      additional dynamic session process startups.  If the ELP 
      process is idle for 15 minutes, or if the STN process stops 
      for any reason, ELP will stop itself.   
      STN will automatically restart the ELP process if and when 
      required.
    
      If STN detects a problem with ELP, STN will stop the ELP 
      process and fall back to the internal RSCMGR for 10 minutes.
    
      ELP works the same as the internal RSCMGR with one important
      exception. This concerns use of Guardian system call
      USER_AUTHENTICATE_ needed for services with LOGON REQ or USER
      attributes. When third party CMON or Safeguard SEEP products 
      are used, they can significantly delay USER_AUTHENTICATE_ 
      processing.
      When the internal RSCMGR is used, this delay can affect all
      sessions for the STN process, but with ELP only single session
      is delayed. Using ELP fixes a deadlock problem when Xypro's 
      CMON tries to communicate with STN.
    
      STN and ELP use encryption and other techniques to protect
      passwords and other sensitive information.
    
      Do not start ELP from a TACL prompt, or it will display the
      following message and stop:
    
          $Znnn ELP can only be started by STN

    STN (pseudo-TTY): A new STNCOM command NBOT_PROC_STOP has been
    added.
    
          NBOT_PROC_STOP   N | Y
    
      NBOT_PROC_STOP controls termination by STN of an application   
      process when EMS event zstn-evt-select-err 1077 occurs. 
      
      NBOT_PROC_STOP defaults to N to suppress this feature. 
    
      NBOT_PROC_STOP Y will call PROCESS_STOP_ to terminate the OSS 
      process that performed the select. This may be useful if 
      repeated $ZTTnn errors result in hanging processes, but at 
      the risk of losing any unsaved data used by the process. 
      
    NOTE:
      Use only under guidance from support staff. An EMS event 
      zstn-evt-stop-process 1028 is generated when a process is
      stopped via this command.

    STN (pseudo-TTY): New EMS event zstn-evt-select-err 1077 is 
    generated when STN cannot send a Select Status Update Request to 
    the TH $ZTTnn process. 
    When this happens the application's select() system call may be 
    left uncompleted (and possibly hang the application).
    
      zstn-evt-select-err 1077

    STN (pseudo-TTY): STN now creates pseudo-open entries for Posix 
    applications that do not generate -103 system open messages.  
    LISTOPENS will indicate these entries by "mx=nnn", referring to 
    the main open entry index for the window.  
    This feature will resolve certain problems with O_NONBLOCK and 
    Posix select handling, in particular allowing multiple 
    application openers of the window (like OSS shell and 
    applications started by the shell) to each have its own setting 
    of O_NONBLOCK. 
    The reported problem was a PUT C++ program which ran the first 
    time but terminated prematurely the second time.

37. [H01^ABV] 
    A new SSH2 parameter ALLOWADDINGKNOWNHOST was added.
    Commands ADD KNOWNHOST and ALTER KNOWNHOST are now controlled
    with options ALL, PARTIALSSHCOMACCESS or FULLSSHCOMACCESS for
    this parameter.
    If the parameter is set to value PARTIALSSHCOMACCESS, then
    only the users with partial or full SSHCOM access can execute
    the restricted KNOWNHOST commands.
    If the parameter is set to value FULLSSHCOMACCESS, then
    only those users with full SSHCOM access can execute the
    restricted KNOWNHOST commands.
    Additionally, if SSH2 parameter STRICTHOSTKEYCHECKING is
    set to false and trust for an unknown remote host key
    could not be established via GSS key exchange, the user
    who started an SSH or SFTP client will not be able to add
    a KNOWNHOST entry for the unknown host unless the user is
    allowed to do that according to the setting of parameter
    ALLOWADDINGKNOWNHOST.
    Before addition of parameter ALLOWADDINGKNOWNHOST,
    the user was always asked if an unknown host key should
    be added to the SSH database in case parameter 
    STRICTHOSTKEYCHECKING was set to false.

    Three new SSH2 parameters CIPROGRAM, SHELLPROGRAM and
    SUBSYSTEMTACLDEFAULTPROGRAM were added, which can be used to 
    override the default values for USER attributes CI-PROGRAM,
    SHELL-PROGRAM and the default program used for subsystem request 
    'TACL', respectively. 
    The default value for CIPROGRAM and SUBSYSTEMTACLDEFAULTPROGRAM 
    is TACL and the default value for SHELLPROGRAM is /bin/sh. Value 
    for the Guardian programs configured in CIPROGRAM and 
    SUBSYSTEMTACLDEFAULTPROGRAM that are not fully specified are
    resolved using SSH2 parameters PMEARCHLISTCI and 
    PMSEARCHLISTSUBSYSTEM. 
    The value configured in SHELLPROGRAM must be specified with the 
    full non-relative path.
    (No SOLN)
   
39. [H01^ABV] 
    Two new SSH2 parameters PMEARCHLISTCI and PMSEARCHLISTSUBSYSTEM 
    were added.
    
    Parameter PMSEARCHLISTCI is used to resolve a Guardian program 
    name configured in USER attribute CI-PROGRAM, in the SSH2 
    parameter CIPROGRAM or specified on an SSH client command line 
    via 'ci -p <program> <cmd>'. 
    
    Parameter PMSEARCHLISTSUBSYSTEM is used to resolve a Guardian 
    program name configured in the SSH2 parameter 
    SUBSYSTEMTACLDEFAULTPROGRAM or specified on an SSH client command
    line via 'tacl -p <program> <cmd>' when a subsystem tacl request 
    is processed.
    
    Each value is a comma-separated list of subvolumes used for file
    name resolution. 
    The default value for both parameters is '$SYSTEM.SYSTEM'. 
    I.e. if USER attribute CI-PROGRAM, <program> from an SSH client 
    command line or values of parameters CIPROGRAM or 
    SUBSYSTEMTACLDEFAULTPROGRAM are not fully specified file names 
    (i.e. do not include all of volume, subvolume and filename), 
    then the file must reside in subvolumes $SYSTEM.SYSTEM or the
    current $SYSTEM.SYSnn.

    The SSH2 process is now a process of subtype 30, ensuring that 
    it receives DEVICEINFO system messages. 
    For DEVICEINFO requests against the SSH2 process without 
    sublocation, SSH2 returns values 46, 0 and 6144 for device type,
    device subtype and record length, respectively.
    
    For DEVICEINFO requests against a dumb terminal that is provided 
    by the SSH2 process (format $SSH.#Tn) in situations where the 
    SSH client does not request a PTY allocation, the SSH2 process 
    returns values 6, 0, 80 for device type, device subtype and 
    record length, respectively.

    Support was added for the SSHCOM command 'SET GSSAUTH <new-
    gssauth-process-name>', which allows the GSSAUTH process to be 
    switched by changing the GSSAUTH setting to a different GSSAUTH 
    process name. 
    New GSSAPI requests will use the new GSSAUTH process after such 
    a change.
    The current value of the GSSAUTH process setting is present in 
    the SSHCOM 'INFO SSH2' command output, under the section 
    'Current configuration'.

    A new USER attribute 'SUBSYSTEM-MAPPING' enables the forcing of 
    TACL subsystem requests handling via a CI-PROGRAM.
    An example command would be:
    
          ALTER USER usr, SUBSYSTEM-MAPPING tacl:ci, 
            ALLOWED-SUBSYSTEMS (sftp,ci)
    The USER attribute ALLOWED-SUBSYSTEMS would be set to (sftp,ci) 
    or (ci) and the SSH2 parameter ALLOWEDSUBSYSTEMS must include 
    'ci', e.g: "tacl,sftp,ci".
    With this configuration, if a user requests a subsystem e.g. 
    via a command such as:
          ssh -s usr@host tacl
    then the configured CI-PROGRAM and CI-COMMAND would be 
    processed.

43. [H01^ABV] 
    By default, SSH provides the terminal id to the 
    USER_AUTHENTICATE_ call executed to allow user impersonation 
    (before starting a user process). 
    This can be controlled by a new boolean SSH2 parameter 
    IMPERSONATEWITHPTY (with default value TRUE).
    
    A pseudo terminal for a user process can be provided by an STN 
    process, configurable via the global SSH2 parameter PTYSERVER 
    or by a user specific setting of the USER attribute PTY-SERVER 
    (making full terminal functionality available).
      
    Alternatively, the SSH2 process can provide a basic terminal 
    with minimal passthrough capability. 
    
    The terminal id of either terminal type will be supplied to the
    USER_AUTHENTICATE_ call if parameter IMPERSONATEWITHPTY is set 
    to true.
    Otherwise the home terminal of the SSH2 process shows up in 
    Safeguard audit records.
    If required, the basic terminals provided by the SSH2 process 
    can be treated differently than the PTYs provided by a PTY
    server. 
    This is achieved by explicitly setting the new boolean SSH2 
    parameter IMPERSONATEWITHSSH2PTY to the intended value.
    
    If parameter IMPERSONATEWITHSSH2PTY is not set, then the same 
    value as that supplied for parameter IMPERSONATEWITHPTY is 
    assumed.

44. [H01^ABV] 
    Two new SSH2 parameters SLOWDOWNTICKS and SLOWDOWNIOS were added
    allowing reduction of CPU utilization by the SSH2 process. 
    If both parameters are configured with non-zero values, then a 
    DELAY is executed after SLOWDOWNIOS I/O completions have 
    occurred, for the number of SLOWDOWNTICKS units (where a
    unit is 0.01 seconds). 
    
    The default value for these parameters is 0, i.e. slow-down 
    processing is disabled.
    Valid values are 0-5 for SLOWDOWNTICKS and 0-1000 for 
    SLOWDOWNIOS.
      
    Corresponding values can be configured for SFTP server 
    (SFTPSERV), SFTP client and SCPOSS processes via parameters 
    SFTPSLOWDOWNTICKS and SFTPSLOWDOWNIOS. 
    
    Additionally there are parameters for SSH clients with names 
    SSHSLOWDOWNTICKS and SSHSLOWDOWNIOS. These parameters will be
    forwarded to local SFTP, SCP, SFTPSERV and SSH processes when 
    they are started or when they open the SSH2 process.
      
    Valid values are 0-50 for SFTPSLOWDOWNTICKS/SSHSLOWDOWNTICKS and
    0-1000 for SFTPSLOWDOWNIOS/SSHSLOWDOWNIOS.
      
    Support was added to the SSHCOM SET command to allow the values 
    of all six slow-down related parameters to be altered 
    dynamically. 
    
    For SSH2 an interactive change of slow-down parameters will
    have an immediate effect on the SSH2 process.
      
    For SFTPSERV, SFTP and SSH processes the new value will not be 
    used by existing processes, only newly started processes.

    The option SUBSET was added to the command INFO SSH2 allowing 
    the user to specify a configuration subset that should be 
    displayed.
      
    Valid values are:
     
    ALL, 
    STARTUP-CONFIGURATION, 
    CURRENT-CONFIGURATION and

    The output for INFO USER, DETAIL now shows the last principal
    name under LAST-PRINCIPAL that was used for the last GSSAPI user 
    authentication.

47. [H01^ABV] 
    Authentication method 'keyboard-interactive' can now be used for 
    password checking if parameter SAFEGUARD-PASSWORD-REQUIRED is 
    set to true. 
    Before this enhancement the only secondary authentication method 
    available was 'password', which was used in this type of 
    situation (possibly after the initial authentication methods, 
    like publickey, had succeeded). 
    If the method 'keyboard-interactive' checks the password (and 
    does not check an RSA code or one-time password, etc. depending 
    on a configured SEEP), then the new SSH2 parameter 
    PASSWORDAUTHENTICATIONMETHODS can be set to the value 
    'password,keyboard-interactive', which will allow both 
    authentication methods 'password' and 'keyboard-interactive'  
    when password retrieval is enforced because parameter 
    SAFEGUARD-PASSWORD-REQUIRED is set to true. 
    
    The default value is 'password', i.e. the same as before the 
    introduction of the parameter.
    (No SOLN)
   
48. [H01^ABV] 
    Added support for multiple required user authentication methods 
    per login via a new USER attribute 'REQUIRED-AUTHENTICATIONS' 
    with values:
      'one' (The default value), 
      'all' and 
      a condition built using AND, OR and names of authentication
      methods.
        This is expressed as a Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), 
        without NOT.
    
    Example SSHCOM commands:
       ALTER USER usr1, REQUIRED-AUTHENTICATIONS ONE
       ALTER USER usr1, REQUIRED-AUTHENTICATIONS ALL
       ALTER USER usr1, REQUIRED-AUTHENTICATIONS &
       (publickey AND password OR publickey and keyboard-interactive)
      
    The default value 'one' corresponds to the processing before 
    introduction of attribute REQUIRED-AUTHENTICATIONS, meaning that 
    one of the methods listed under attribute 
    ALLOWED-AUTHENTICATIONS must be successful to grant access.
    
    The value 'all' means that all of the methods listed under 
    attribute ALLOWED-AUTHENTICATIONS must be successful to grant 
    access.
    
    If the value is a condition in Disjunctive Normal Form, then, 
    after each successfully completed user authentication method, 
    the condition for granting access is evaluated obeying the 
    common higher precedence of logical operator AND over operator 
    OR.
    
    Where multiple authentication methods were required for 
    authenticating a user, then the informational USER field 
    LAST-AUTH-METHOD is set to the list of conjunct methods actually 
    executed.

    Added the SSH2 process name to the SSH version string as part 
    of the comment field. 
    The format is now:
          SSH-<protoversion>-<softwareversion> SP <comments> CR LF 
      (SP stands for space character) with <protocolversion '2.0' 
    and <comments> consisting of
          <SSH2-vproc> ':' <SSH2-process-name-including-node-name>
    If SSH2 parameter SUPPRESSCOMMENTINSSHVERSION is set to TRUE, 
    then the SSH version string has the following format:
          SSH-<protoversion>-<softwareversion> CR LF
    I.e. the comment part is suppressed as configured.

    Added new SSH2 parameter ALLOWADDINGPRIVATEKEY. 
    Commands IMPORT KEY, GENERATE KEY and ALTER KEY are now 
    controlled with options ALL, PARTIALSSHCOMACCESS or 
    FULLSSHCOMACCESS for this parameter.  
    If the parameter is set to value PARTIALSSHCOMACCESS, then only 
    the users with partial or full SSHCOM access can execute the 
    restricted KEY commands. If the parameter is set to value 
    FULLSSHCOMACCESS, then only those users with full SSHCOM access 
    can execute the restricted KEY commands.

    ESSH_HOSTVERIFY/6008.
    The new error detail code will be used if a remote host key 
    is unknown and trust could not be established via GSS key 
    exchange and the parameter STRICTHOSTKEYCHECKING is set to 
    FALSE and the user is not allowed to add KNOWNHOST entries as

54. [H01^ABV] 
    Added new SSH2 parameter SFTPMAPEXTENSIONTOGUARDIANFILE, which 
    allows different ways how a file name with extension 
    <filename>.<extension> gets mapped to produce a valid Guardian 
    name (OSS file names are not processed regarding extension 
    mapping). Supported values are: 
      - APPENDTOFILENAME: The <extension> is added to the <filename>.
        Then the resulting filename part is truncated at 8 
        characters.
      - FILENAME: The <extension> gets mapped to the filename part 
        of a Guardian file and the <filename> will be used as 
        subvolume name.
      - CUTFILENAMEANDAPPEND: The <extension> is used (up to 7 
        characters) and the first characters of the <filename> 
        are used as first part of the resulting Guardian filename 
        (minimum of 1 character taken from <filename> part).
      - DROP: The <extension> gets dropped and just the part 
        <filename> (up to 8 characters) is used to create a valid 
        Guardian file name.
    Any occurrences of underscore ('_') and dash ('-') 
    characters as well as superfluous dot characters ('.') 
    are removed to build a valid Guardian path.
    The default value is APPENDTOFILENAME. This is an incompatible 
    change as the processing of extension mapping before 
    introduction of parameter SFTPMAPEXTENSIONTOGUARDIANFILE 
    corresponds to value FILENAME, i.e. the default processing 
    has changed from FILENAME to APPENDTOFILENAME. If the previous 
    processing needs to be used, the parameter
    SFTPMAPEXTENSIONTOGUARDIANFILE needs to be set to value 
    FILENAME.

    Although the behavior is controlled by SAFEGUARD a usability

    have the Safeguard DISKFILE entry with PRIV-LOGON set to 
    ON even though READ ACCESS is not set in that DISKFILE

    STN (pseudo-TTY): A new STNCOM command ?EMS can be used to 
    display text on the EMS log.  This command is restricted to 
    PRIV users (as defined by PARAM SECURITY).
    
        ?EMS <text>
    
    <text> is displayed in zstn-evt-misc event.  Any text beyond
    128 characters is ignored.  Non-displayable characters (ascii
    less than 0x20 or greater than 0x7e) are replaced with ".".
    
    ?EMS is useful for clarifying which STN ?SECTION is in effect, 
    to annotate the EMS log when running tests or changing
    configuration, etc.  Example in an obey file:
    
        ?EMS STNCOM obey file $a.stn.addlis 2/17/2015 R. Smith
        ?EMS configure DR system admin access

64. [H01^ABP] 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): A new STNCOM command ?SECTION has been added to
    allow partitioning of STNCOM command (IN or OBEY) files.  
    This allows STN processes to use the same command file while 
    restricting some commands to a specific STN process.  
    This is primarily intended for use when starting STN as a 
    $ZZKRN kernel persistent process.
    
        ?SECTION <pname> | <cpunum> | ALL
    
    ?SECTION commands may appear anywhere in an IN or OBEY file.
    The parameter is either an STN process name, beginning with
    '$', a cpu number, or 'ALL'.
    
        ?SECTION <pname>      <pname> is an STN process name
                              beginning with '$'.  It is compared
                              to the name of the STN process.
    
        ?SECTION <cpunum>     <cpunum> is 0-15.  It is compared to
                              the (primary) cpu number of the STN
                              process.
    
        ?SECTION ALL          Always matches.
    
        ?SECTION <other>      Anything else is a 'no match'.
    
    If a match is found, subsequent STNCOM commands are accepted
    and processed.  If no match, then STNCOM commands are ignored
    until the next ?SECTION command.  The initial state is
    '?SECTION ALL', so commands preceding any ?SECTION are always
    accepted.
    
    ?SECTION may be used in an STNCOM IN file, STNCOM OBEY file,
    or the file specified by RUN STN / IN <file>/.  If ?SECTION is
    used in an OBEY file, its effect continues past the end of the
    OBEY file. ?SECTION may also manually typed in response to an
    STNCOM prompt. This allows terminal emulator scripts and
    automated responses to include ?SECTION, although this would
    be an unusual and somewhat confusing application.
    
    When ?SECTION is encountered in the IN file on the RUN STN or
    $ZZKRN startup, zstn^evt^misc EMS events are generated for
    every ?SECTION command indicating match or no match.  Examples:
    
        $STN8 ?SECTION 'ALL' - matches
        $STN8 ?SECTION $STN8 - matches
        $STN8 ?SECTION $STN7 - does not match
    
    Since PARAM commands also generate EMS events, this gives a
    complete journal of the configuration commands actually used.
    
    See also ?EMS command (below).
    
    Example 1: STN started by $ZZKRN in all cpus, using IN file:

    STN (pseudo-TTY): In addition to alpha and numeric characters,

        clarity it is recommended that use of special characters be
        minimized.

    ignores BREAK received when there is no application owner of 
    BREAK.
    
       BREAK_IGNORE_NBO      Y | N
    
            BREAK_IGNORE_NBO controls handling of break received
            from the terminal when there is no application owner
            of BREAK.
    
            BREAK_IGNORE_NBO Y ignores the break. The stix counter
            IGNORE BREAK NBO is incremented by 1.
    
            BREAK_IGNORE_NBO N terminates the session with a STN60

            STN39   Y | N
    
    An application can terminate the session by sending control 12 
    or by closing all opens to the STN window.
    
    With STN39 Y (default, compatible with B32 and earlier 
    releases) the STN39 message is displayed at the terminal for 
    5-10 seconds, then the session is terminated.  
    With STN39 N, there is no STN39 message and no delay.

    starting the trace:
    
        TRACE ON [$vol.[subvol.]]*
    
        PARAM TRACE^FILE [$vol.[subvol.]]*
    
    The generated filename is ZThhmmss using the Local Civil time
    in hours, minutes, and seconds.  This generated filename is
    displayed in trace-related EMS events and in responses to
    TRACE commands.
    
    If a trace is active and a backup takeover occurs, the trace
    is restarted. If '*' was used, a new ZThhmmss file will be
    created; otherwise the trace file which was active at the time
    of takeover will be overwritten.
    
    PLEASE NOTE:
    The command BUP_TRACE is no longer supported.

    STN (pseudo-TTY) A new command 'ORPHAN' was added, which 
    displays a list of openers of windows that have been deleted 
    (because the session was terminated). The most common cause is 
    a TACL that was PAUSED when the session was terminated from the 
    remote end, and BREAK_ON_DISCON is set to the default N.  
    'ORPHAN' displays the opener process name, window name, and the 
    object filename of the opener.  Stopping orphaned processes 
    should be done with care.  For TACL orphans, the old WAKE
    utility will usually cause the TACL to stop.

    Support was added for SSHCOM command FLUSH SAFEGUARDCACHE.  
    The SSH2 process holds information like Safeguard OBJECTTYPE 
    USER record, user and alias configuration and diskfile 
    protection records in a memory cache, refreshing the information 
    automatically, 5 minutes after the last retrieval.  
    This means that it can take up to 5 minutes before a Safeguard 
    change has an effect on the SSH2 processing.  If it is required 
    to activate the Safeguard modifications immediately, then the 
    command FLUSH SAFEGUARDCACHE should be used to clear the cache, 
    thus forcing the SSH2 process to freshly retrieve the required 
    information immediately after processing the command.

78. [H01^ABP] 
    Support was added for the Guardian option 'unstructured access 
    of structured files' allowing greater flexibility in handling 
    unstructured partitioned files.  The transfer mode U is no 
    longer ignored when specified for the source file in a put 
    operation if the source file is an unstructured partitioned file.
    Examples of SFTP commands using the u transfer mode for 
    partitioned files:
    
    dir unstp1                       
              # displays summary size of all partitions
    dir unstp1,u                      
              # displays size of first partition only
    put unstp1 $data1.test.unstp1   
              # all partitions in one go
    get $data1.test.unstp1 unstp1       
              # all partitions in one go
    put unstp1,u $data1.test.unstp1,u   
              # just first partition
    put $disk.x.unstp2,u $data1.test.unstp2,u 
              # just second partition
    put part1,u /tmp/unstpart      
              # just first partition
    get /tmp/unstpart part1,u       
              # just first partition
    
    This allows separate transfers of each partition of an 
    unstructured partitioned file in multiple put commands 
    (possibly in parallel sftp sessions).  Support was also 
    added for writing to Guardian files using the transfer 
    mode u ('unstructured access of structured files').  
    See section "Transfer Modes for Structured Guardian Files"

    Support for SSHCOM command "SET PTYSERVER <process-name>" was 
    added, allowing the PTY server process to be switched by setting
    the global PTYSERVER setting to a different PTY server process.  
    New PTY requests will use the new PTY server process for PTY 
    processing after such a command.  Existing sessions are not 
    interrupted.  Any user-specific PTY-SERVER settings are not 
    modified by the "SET PTYSERVER" command, i.e. these settings 
    must be modified by executing the SSHCOM command  
    "ALTER USER xyz, PTY-SERVER <process-name>"  as needed.

    KNOWNHOST entity in the SSH DB. 
    Note: This list of resolved IP addresses might not always stay 
    static and a DNS might resolve a hostname differently for 
    follow-up connections and therefore a remote IP address might

    Added support for a command interface allowing parallel updates
    of multiple databases, or displaying the status of multiple SSH2 
    processes. Changes are applied to multiple databases by 
    executing commands against multiple SSH2 processes on different 
    systems reachable via EXPAND network or residing on the
    same system. The functionality is provided by macro MSSHCOM 
    that accepts a list of SSH2 process names as optional parameters
    which can be followed by one or more commands; for instance:
    "MSSHCOM $SSH00 $SSH01 \NODE1.$SSH00 \NODE1.$SSH01 STATUS SESSION
    *; TIME".
    
    MSSHCOM can be started without parameters and SSH2 processes can 
    be added via the OPEN command or removed from the list of SSH2
    processes via the CLOSE command. See HELP command for details, 
    issued at the MSSHCOM prompt.
    
    Special processing for GENERATE KEY ensures that only one key is
    generated which then gets automatically propagated to the other
    processes via EXPORT/IMPORT KEY.
    
    A similar command interface is MSTNCOM, which allows 
    configuration changes or status inquiries against multiple PTY
    server (STN) processes; for instance:
    "MSTNCOM $ZPTY $PPTY $ZPTY2 STATUS WINDOW".

    DNS host name resolving has been enhanced to support multiple
    IP addresses returned for a specific host name. Previously only 
    the first IP address was used. A new SSH2 parameter DNSMODE 
    controls the behavior. Valid values for the new parameter are
    FIRST and ALL. The default is FIRST ensuring the change is 
    compatible with previous versions of SSH2. This is not only 
    relevant for target host names but also for names configured
    in parameter INTERFACE and INTERFACEOUT so that now multiple
    listens will be issued even if only one host name is configured
    for INTERFACE in case the DNS name resolving results in multiple
    IP addresses. Similarly, local IP addresses used for outgoing 
    connections are now selected from a list of IP addresses in case
    multiple addresses are configured for a host name configured via
    INTERFACEOUT.
    (SOLN 10-120730-4271)
   
111. [H01^ABK] 
    The parameters SUBNET, INTERFACE and INTERFACEOUT can now be 
    lists of IP addresses and domain names. Previously, each of
    these parameters could only contain one IP address. Together 
    with DNSMODE ALL, the number of IP addresses to handle is no 
    longer restricted to one. The SSH2 process will now start 
    multiple listens on multiple IP addresses if the configuration 
    requires this. If all configured local IP addresses
    of an IP process are listed in the INTERFACE parameter, then a
    listen on the any address will be started (0.0.0.0 or 0::0 
    depending on the IPMODE) for that IP process to keep the number
    of listeners small. Otherwise a listen will be started for each
    local IP address of the IP process that is listed in INTERFACE.
    For outgoing connections, one of the interfaces configured via
    INTERFACEOUT is selected in round-robin fashion. An appropriate
    TCP/IP process is selected accordingly. If a local SSH/SFTP
    client specifies a local IP address (via option 
    -oBindAddress=<ip-address>), then this IP address is used but
    only if it is configured in INTERFACEOUT.

112. [H01^ABK] 
    The differentiation between subsystem tacl and use of CI-PROGRAM
    was enhanced, allowing a configuration that rejects subsystem
    tacl requests but allows execution of pre-configured CI-PROGRAM. 
    Previously, the execution of CI-PROGRAM via TACL command on the
    SSH client command line was rejected if tacl was not an allowed 
    subsystem. Now the tacl subsystem can be removed from the list
    of ALLOWED-SUBSYSTEMS but the execution of commands via 
    TACL -c <command> and TACL -p is still allowed as long as the
    USER attribute ALLOW-CI is set to YES.
    If an EXEC request is received and subsystem tacl is not allowed,
    then either -p or -c must be specified. Otherwise the user would
    get a TACL prompt, which should not be allowed if tacl is not an
    allowed subsystem.
    This enhancement includes the possibility to use subsystem tacl
    and CI-PROGRAM independently of subsystem tacl being allowed.
    Previously, the subsystem tacl was initiated for an EXEC tacl 
    request. In order to be compatible with the previous behavior,
    EXEC tacl still starts subsystem tacl if tacl is an allowed
    subsystem. But now it is possible to specify a new command "ci"
    (instead of "tacl") on the SSH client command line with options
    -c <cmd> and -p <program> <cmd> with the same meaning as
    the tacl -p and -c options.
    The processing of EXEC ci is as follows if ALLOW-CI is set to
    YES:
    - Case "ci": the value of USER attribute CI-PROGRAM is started
    as command interpreter (default: $system.system.tacl). If 
    additionally CI-COMMAND is configured, then this command is
    executed.
    - Case "ci -c <cmd>": the value of USER attribute CI-PROGRAM is 
    started as command interpreter (default: $system.system.tacl)
    and the command <cmd> is executed by the command interpreter 
    unless CI-COMMAND is configured. In this case the command <cmd>
    is ignored and the command configured under user attribute 
    CI-COMMAND is executed.
    - Case "ci -p <program> [<cmd>]": the program 
    $system.system.<program> is started and if <cmd> is specified,
    then this command is executed. If no <cmd> is specified, then
    the user will get the prompt of the command interpreter and can
    enter commands interactively. It is possible that a user
    specifies "ci -p tacl" but the access of tacl may not be allowed
    for the user. Therefore a new USER attribute
    ALLOW-CI-PROGRAM-OVERRIDE determines if a user is allowed to use
    tacl -p. The default value for attribute 
    ALLOW-CI-PROGRAM-OVERRIDE is NO. With this enhancement, if
    subsystem tacl is not allowed, an EXEC request like
    "tacl -c <cmd>" or "tacl -p <program> <cmd>" will be 
    automatically converted to "ci -c <cmd>" and 
    "ci -p <program> <cmd>", respectively, and handled accordingly.

    A new USER attribute OWNER was introduced, similar to the

    USER records that are configured with that local user as value
    for new USER attribute OWNER. The allowed actions will
    be the same as defined by PARTIALSSHCOMACCESSUSER/GROUP 
    parameters. The OWNER field for existing USER records will be
    assumed to be *NONE*. New USER records will be set to
    OWNER *NONE* by default unless attribute OWNER is explicitly set
    to a different value. The owner could be identical to the
    SYSTEM-USER value, could be SUPER.SUPER, or the group manager of
    the user configured in SYSTEM-USER, or could be any other local 
    system user.
    A new parameter DAEMONMODEOWNERPOLICY is introduced, similar to 
    CLIENTMODEOWNERPOLICY but controlling access for the server mode
    USER records. Valid values are LOGINNAME, GUARDIANNAME, BOTH and
    NONE. The latter is the default value and also represents the
    setting for previous versions regarding USER record access. 
    Access allowed due to settings of PARTIALSSHCOMACCESSUSER/GROUP
    parameters and Safeguard OBJECTTYPE USER record are independent
    of the OWNER of a record, i.e. partial/full access allowed via
    PARTIALSSHCOMACCESSUSER/GROUP parameters and Safeguard
    OBJECTTYPE USER record is not affected by this enhancement.

    A new OUT command was implemented in SSHCOM and STNCOM to 
    switch the output file:
    
    OUT <filename> | STOP
     with:
       STOP  Output to home terminal
       <filename>  If this is a disc file that does not exist,
                   it is created as file code 101 unstructured
                   and is written as an edit-101 file.
                   If <filename> is an existing unstructured disc
                   file with code 101, it is erased and written as
                   an edit-101 file.
                   If <filename> is an existing disc file that is
                   not unstructured or not code 101, or a non disc
                   file, then the file is opened and sent lines of
                   output.

    Added support for the local host key type RSA. Before this 
    enhancement, only type DSA was supported for the local host key;
    key types RSA and DSA have always been supported as remote host 
    key type. The host key type can be configured via new SSH2
    parameter HOSTKEYTYPE. The key length can be configured via SSH2
    parameter HOSTKEYBITS with supported values 1024 for DSA and
    1024 or 2048 for RSA. During startup, the key length is now 
    logged and the output of SSHCOM command INFO HOST-KEY now shows
    the host key length. Parameter HOSTKEYPASS is no longer
    displayed, neither during startup nor in SSHCOM command

    SSH2 parameter SFTPREALPATHFILEATTRIBUTEECHOED has been added,
    enabling the echoing of the comma-separated list of file 
    attributes in a realpath call of the client. SFTP clients like
    PuTTY command line program sftp call realpath for the remote
    file in a put command first, and then try to open the returned
    file name. The problem with this approach is that the SFTPSERV 
    implementation of realpath strips the file attributes by default
    before returning the file name. This basically means that the 
    specified file attributes do not reach the open and are
    effectively ignored. For PuTTY clients this will be automatically
    done. Should there be other clients that show the same 
    behavior, a new boolean parameter called 
    SFTPREALPATHFILEATTRIBUTEECHOED was introduced, allowing
    file attribute echoing for other clients. Default value is
    FALSE to ensure compatibility with previous versions. If this
    parameter is set to TRUE, then the file attributes will be 
    echoed back to the client in the realpath response, i.e. the 
    file attributes end up at the SFTPSERV on Nonstop in the open
    call and will no longer be ignored.

    A new USER attribute PTY-SERVER has been introduced. A newly

    terminal handling over different PTY server processes. Also, it
    is now possible to configure different STN service menus for

    SSH and SFTP clients on the NonStop:  as a response to the

    prompt, only "yes" or "no" are accepted, and when a different
    character sequence or an empty response is detected, the prompt
    "Please type yes or no at the prompt in next line" is now
    displayed. Previously, the SSH process would terminate with a 
    connection abort and no further error indication. As a response
    to the "Add password for <user@ipaddr:port> to the password
    store (yes/no)" prompt, "yes/no" and also "y/n" are accepted as
    before, but when a different character sequence or an empty

    STN (pseudo-TTY): New command C12_ALWAYS was introduced to modify
    control 12 (terminate session) application requests.
    
      C12_ALWAYS  Y | N
    
    Y means control 12 requests always terminate the session
    regardless of the number of applications that currently have
    the terminal window open. Y is the default and is compatible
    with STN B21 and earlier releases.
    N means control 12 requests are ignored unless there is only
    one remaining application open to the terminal window. Control
    12 requests will only terminate the session when there is
    only one application open for the terminal window.
    
    C12_ALWAYS should be set to N when one application starts
    another (which may in turn start yet another, etc), and
    control 12 requests from the secondary (etc) applications are
    to be ignored. This fixes a problem with Xygate DBSO and XAC 
    where LOGOFF of a nested TACL would terminate the session
    instead of returning to the DBSO prompt.

    can be enabled via target specific boolean parameters called 
    EMSBURSTSUPPRESSION, CONSOLEBURSTSUPPRESSION,

    STN (pseudo-TTY): Session (and dynamic window) names always 
    began at 0000 when STN was started. This resulted in the same 
    session name being used for different STN processes or for
    restarts of an STN process. The session names should be unique.
    
    A new, optional, naming scheme used for sessions and dynamic
    windows is now available. The default still uses names like
    #ZWN0001.
    
    A related new feature provides for the pooling of window names
    over multiple STN processes, and over restarts of STN processes.
      
     PARAM GWN^TEMPLATE #AAAnnn
    
        GWN^TEMPLATE allows the format of session names to be
        configured.  Window names have the syntax:
    
        #AAAnnn
    
             #    must appear as the first char
    
             AAA  alphabetic prefix, 1 to 4 letters
    
             nnn  numeric suffix, 2 to 5 decimal digits
    
             Total must be 4 to 8 characters including "#".
    
        Examples:
    
             #TERM000    increments to #TERM999, then back to
                         #TERM000.
                         1,000 unique names.
    
             #P77        increments to #P99 then back to #P00.
                         Shortest possible name. 100 unique names.
    
             #AB12345    cycles to #AB99999 then back to #AB00000.
                         100,000 unique names (maximum allowed).
    
         If GWN^TEMPLATE is not used, or does not follow the above
         rules, a default of #ZWN0001 is used, which is compatible
         with STN B19 and earlier.
    
         GWN^TEMPLATE defines both the format of the name and
         the starting window name.  As sessions are started,
         the numeric suffix is incremented until it reaches
         all nines, then the next window name wraps back
         to all zeroes.  Using a short numeric suffix makes
         typing window names easier.  Using a longer numeric
         suffix allows for more sessions before a window
         name is reused.
    
         GWN^TEMPLATE may be used with or without GWN^FILE.
    
     PARAM  GWN^INITIAL RANDOM
     
         If this param is present and is set to the value RANDOM,
         the initial value is randomly computed from the
         microsecond clock.  Otherwise, the number in GWN^TEMPLATE,
         if present, is used, or else the default of 0001.
    
         GWN^INITIAL may be used with or without GWN^FILE.
    
     PARAM GWN^FILE      <filename>
    
         GWN^FILE names a central disc file where the next window 
         name is stored. Normally, all STN processes would share the
         same file by using the same PARAM GWN^FILE value. 
         <filename> must name a disc file.
    
         If the file does not exist, it is created as an unstructured
         disc file, code 1107, and initialized using GWN^TEMPLATE and
         GWN^INITIAL. If it cannot be created or written, the default
         of #ZWN0001 is used.
    
         If the file exists, it is validated as containing a valid
         GWN record. If the GWN record is valid, STN allocates an 
         initial block of window names as described below. The window
         name stored in the file overrides any GWN^TEMPLATE.
    
         If the file exists but an error occurs while opening or 
         reading the file, or the file does not contain valid GWN
         data, STN closes the file, generates an EMS warning and 
         runs without GWN^FILE for the duration of the STN process.
         No recovery is attempted. If it cannot be created or 
         written, the default of #ZWN0001 is used.
    
         If <filename> is OFF, or the PARAM is omitted, then the 
         default of #ZWN0001 is used.
    
     PARAM GWN^BLOCKSIZE <nnn>
    
         When GWN^FILE is used, GWN operates by allocating a block of
         consecutively numbered window names at a time.  This allows
         multiple STN processes to use the same range of window names
         without duplicating any names.  It also allows a restarted
         STN process to avoid duplicating names previously used.
    
         GWN^BLOCKSIZE specifies the number of window names to be
         allocated in each block, in the range 10-1000.  If 
         GWN^BLOCKSIZE is not specified, or contains an illegal
         value, a default or 25 is used.  
         Allocation works as follows:
    
           STN reads GWN file (with locking) to get the next window
           name.
    
           This window name and the next <blocksize>-1 consecutive
           window names are reserved for use by this STN process.
    
           STN adds <blocksize> to the numeric portion of the window
           name and rewrites (with unlock) GWN file.
    
           STN then uses the reserved window names for new sessions.
           When the reserved list is exhausted, another allocation is
           performed.
    
           If any error occurs reading or writing GWN^FILE, the file
           is closed and the default #ZWN0001 is used for the
           duration of the STN process.
    
         GWN^BLOCKSIZE is automatically reduced if necessary so that 
         is does not exceed tenth of the numeric range defined by
         GWN^TEMPLATE. For example, with GWN^TEMPLATE #T00, there are
         only 100 names in the range, so the maximum is 10.
         For #PTY0000, the maximum is 1000.
    
         With this allocation scheme, there may be some gaps in
         window numbering, but there will generally be no 
         duplication, which can simplify tracking of windows.
    
     STNCOM command INFO STN
    
         displays GWN parameters
    
     STNCOM command DYN_WIN_MAX
    
         The existing DYN_WIN_MAX command is generally superseded
         by the features of GWN^TEMPLATE, but it is still allowed.
    
             DYN_WIN_MAX nnn
    
             nnn is the maximum number of window names, including
             zero (0).  nnn must be ion the range 100 to 100000,
             default 100000.  DYN_WIN_MAX may be used to reduce
             the number of windows allowed by GWN^TEMPLATE.  For
             example:
    
             PARAM GWN^TEMPLATE #Z0000
             STNCOM $STN ; DYN_WIN_MAX 250
    
             cycles from #Z0000 to #Z0249, then back to #Z0000.
    
     STNCOM command GWN
    
        STNCOM displays the GWN filename and details about the

             If ALLOC is specified, a new block of session names is 
             allocated from GWN^FILE. Since allocation is normally 
             done automatically, ALLOC is intended for development
             use only. Any window names reserved by a previous 
             GWN^FILE allocation but not yet used are
             discarded. The next session will begin with the number
             just allocated.
    
      EMS events
    
         EMS events are generated at GWN initialization, 
         whenever allocations are made from GWN^FILE, and 
         whenever any errors occur. 
         Refer to the section on EMS events.

    There is now support for a PROGRESS meter command option "?",
    which leads to an informational message about the current
    setting of the progress meter mode.  This feature has been added
    in SSH version 0092b.
    (No SOLN)
   
140. [H01^ABC] 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): New setmode 214 was introduced to override the
    results of deviceinfo (and related calls) against a window. 
    Open a window and use setmode 214 with both P1 and P2 specified.
    If P1 is nonzero, then it overrides the device type and device 
    subtype returned by deviceinfo. The device type is taken from 
    P1.<4:9> and the subtype from P1.<10:15>. If P2 is nonzero, then
    it overrides the record length returned by deviceinfo. No range 
    checking is done on either parameter. Setmode 214 P1 and P2 both
    default to zero when a window is added, and the value is not
    changed or reset by session termination or startup (unless
    it is part of a SCRIPT).
    
    Setmode 214 may be used with ADD SCRIPT, but with a static 
    window the script will not be applied until the first session
    connects.

141. [H01^ABC] 
    SFTP[OSS]: Now allows bytes transferred after a successful file 
    transfer be either the EOF value (default) as before or the 
    actually transferred number of bytes, which can greatly differ
    from EOF value for Guardian edit and structured files. This
    feature works for SFTP, SFTPOSS and when using SFTPAPI.
    It is controlled via define =SFTP^BYTES^TRANSFERRED with 
    supported values EOF (EOF value will be used) and ACTUAL (actual
    number of bytes transferred will be used).
    (SOLN 10-120524-3307)
   
142. [H01^ABC] 
    SFTP (Guardian): Now only one line is written for the progress
    meter information showing the transfer rate and time remaining.
    Every update overwrites this line.
    
    SFTP[OSS]: Now allows reducing the progress meter output via 
    "progress min" sftp command. The minimum progress meter output
    shows action and name per file transfer plus a summary line
    (bytes transferred) but no progress per file.
    (SOLN 10-120521-3252)
   
143. [H01^ABC] 
    Added support for command TEST RESTRICTION-PROFILE to test the
    restriction profile configuration.
    (No SOLN)
   
144. [H01^ABC] 
    Added support for LIKE option for SSHCOM server-mode command
    ADD RESTRICTION-PROFILE, allowing to copy an existing 
    restriction profile record easily.
    (No SOLN)
   
145. [H01^ABC] 
    Added new SSHCOM CLIENT mode command INFO SYSTEM-USER to allow
    getting a similar view on a system user's configuration in the
    SSHCTL database like the SSHCOM DAEMON mode command INFO USER
    does for the SSH user configuration stored in the SSHCTL
    database.
    (No SOLN)
   
146. [H01^ABC] 
    Added support for a bind address option in SSH[OSS]/SFTP[OSS] 
    clients, set via flag -oBindAddress=<subnet-ip-address>. The
    clients can set the bind address only if the default bind 
    address configured for the SSH2 process (value of parameter 
    INTERFACEOUT) is the unspecified address (e.g. 0.0.0.0 in IPMODE
    IPV4). If INTERFACEOUT contains a specific address, then the 
    SSH2 process ignores the BindAddress value received from a local
    client.
    (SOLN 10-120131-2679)
   
147. [H01^ABC] 
    Added a check for the file security settings of the SSHCTL and 
    HOSTKEY file. The expected file security is 07777 ("----"),
    which is the security set at file creation. If during startup of
    the SSH2 process the file security is found to be different 
    from the expected value, then the file security is set back to
    07777.
    (No SOLN)
   
148. [H01^ABC] 
    Added support for combinations of existing run modes, separated
    by an underscore, namely CLIENT_ADMIN and SERVER_ADMIN.
    Previously, it was not possible to activate run modes CLIENT 
    plus ADMIN excluding SERVER, or run modes SERVER and ADMIN
    excluding CLIENT. Any change in the configuration required to
    start a new SSH2 process or to ensure at least one SSH2 process
    per SSH database was running in a mode that included
    ADMIN (ALL or ADMIN). Retrieving information from a running SSH2
    process in CLIENT and SERVER run mode has not been possible.
    As an alternate name for the combination of run modes CLIENT and
    ADMIN, the run mode ADMIN_CLIENT can be used. For the combination
    of run modes  SERVER and ADMIN, the alternate names ADMIN_SERVER,
    DAEMON_ADMIN, and ADMIN_DAEMON are allowed.
    
    All previously defined run modes are still valid.
    (No SOLN)
   
149. [H01^ABC] 
    SFTP[OSS]: Added support for creation of format 2 files. In
    previous releases, existing format 2 files could be overwritten
    but not newly created. The indication for format 2 files is a
    plus sign appended to the file code in the guardian file 
    attributes, like in FILEINFO output.
    Example: sftp> get remote local,101+,28,56,128
    (No SOLN)
   
150. [H01^ABC] 
    Added support for SFTP commands append (short form ap) and 
    lappend (short form lap). Like the FTP append command, the SFTP 
    append command reads a local file and appends the content to a
    remote file. The SFTP lappend command reads a remote file and 
    locally appends the content of the remote file to the local file.
    
    Both the append and the lappend command create the target file
    if it does not exist. In this case the append command behaves 
    exactly like the put command, and the lappend command's
    processing is the same as done for the get command.
    (SOLN 10-120229-1896)
   
151. [H01^ABC] 
    Added parameter ALLOWINFOSSH2 to control the set of users that
    are allowed to execute SSHCOM command INFO SSH2. Possible values
    are: ALL, PARTIALSSHCOMACCESS, and FULLSSHCOMACCESS.
    The default value is ALL in which case any user can execute
    the INFO SSH2 command as before.
    (No SOLN)
   
152. [H01^ABC] 
    Added support for user public key life cycles (i.e. PUBLICKEY
    entries of USER records). This allows defining a time interval
    during which a user's public key is valid. Parameter
    LIFECYCLEPOLICYPUBLICUSERKEY enables or disables the life cycle
    policy for all users. It can be enabled by setting it to
    FIXED or VARIABLE, and disabled by setting it to DISABLED which
    is also the default. FIXED means that a user without full 
    SSHCOM access is not allowed to change the public key life cycle,
    while value VARIABLE allows users with partial SSHCOM access to
    modify the public key life cycle. Public key life cycle states 
    can be either PENDING, LIVE, or EXPIRED. The key life cycle
    state cannot be set directly but is determined from new 
    PUBLICKEY attributes LIVE-DATE (not valid before date) and
    EXPIRE-DATE (not valid after date).
    
    In addition to these two new PUBLICKEY attributes, the time at
    which a key was added is held in attribute CREATION-DATE.
    Existing SSHCOM daemon-mode command ALTER USER <user>, PUBLICKEY
    now supports the two new PUBLICKEY attributes LIVE-DATE and
    EXPIRE-DATE.
    
    If parameter LIFECYCLEPOLICYPUBLICUSERKEY is set to FIXED or 
    VARIABLE, but no LIVE-DATE and EXPIRE-DATE is specified in the
    ALTER USER commands, then the values for LIVE-DATE and 
    EXPIRE-DATE are calculated using intervals defining how long a
    key stays in PENDING state after creation and how long a
    key stays in LIVE state. The length of the first interval in 
    days is defined by new SSH2 parameter 
    INTERVALPENDINGPUBLICUSERKEY (default 0) while the second 
    interval in days is defined by new SSH2 parameter
    INTERVALLIVEPUBLICUSERKEY (default value is two years, i.e.
    2*365). Example command:
    
      ALTER USER test.usr, PUBLICKEY k12 (FILE ky012, LIVE-DATE  
      4Jun2012, EXPIRE-DATE 5Aug2013, COMMENT "some comment")
    
    The parentheses in the above command are required only if
    multiple attributes of the user public key are set/altered, i.e.
    the old format of the ALTER USER <user>, PUBLICKEY command
    is still valid.
    (No SOLN)
   
153. [H01^ABC] 
    Added parameter sets PARTIALSSHCOMACCESSGROUPn and 
    PARTIALSSHCOMACCESSUSERn allowing the specified user(s) to 
    alter all attributes of any entity USER except attributes
    ALLOWED-AUTHENTICATIONS and SYSTEM-USER. These attributes
    are regarded as most sensitive, hence can only be modified by
    users with full SSHCOM access.
    
    Restriction: Users configured via these new parameter sets can
    only issue INFO USER and ALTER USER commands, i.e. these users
    can not create new USER records. The ALTER USER commands must
    not contain attributes SYSTEM-USER or ALLOWED-AUTHENTICATIONS,
    otherwise the ALTER USER command will be rejected. These users
    are not allowed to issue other USER related commands (i.e. ADD,
    DELETE, FREEZE, RENAME, THAW). This feature defines reduced
    (partial) SSHCOM access.
    
    If a user is configured in the OBJECTTYPE USER record with
    ACCESS C, then this overwrites the PARTIALSSHCOMACCESSGROUPn/
    PARTIALSSHCOMACCESSUSERn configuration for that user, i.e. such
    a user has full access. But ACCESS DENY C entries in OBJECTTYPE
    USER will never revoke the limited rights granted by 
    PARTIALSSHCOMACCESS... parameters (ACCESS DENY C denies
    full access but not partial access).
    
    Similarly, if the OBJECTTYPE USER record does not exist, but a 
    user is configured in FULLSSHCOMACCESSGROUPn or 
    FULLSSHCOMACCESSUSERn, then this overwrites the 
    PARTIALSSHCOMACCESSGROUPn and PARTIALSSHCOMACCESSUSERn 
    configuration for that user, i.e. such a user has full access.

154. [H01^ABC] 
    IPV6 enhancement:
      + Added SSH2 parameter IPMODE with values IPV4, IPV6 and DUAL
      + Added support for IPv6 addresses used in entities KNOWNHOST,
        PASSWORD, and USER
      + Modified SSHCOM ADD/ALTER commands for KNOWNHOST, PASSWORD
        and USER entities to support IPV6 addresses
      + Modified SSHCOM INFO/STATUS output for fields that may
        contain IPV6 addresses
      + Modified SSH[OSS] and SFTP[OSS] clients to support IPV6 
        addresses
      + Added support for IPv6 addresses as INTERFACE and 
        INTERFACEOUT parameter values
      + Added support for parameters SOCKTCPMINRXMT 
        (allows setting the minimum time for TCP retransmission 
        timeout), SOCKTCPMAXRXMT (allows setting the maximum time for
        TCP retransmission timeout), SOCKTCPRXMTCNT (allows setting
        the maximum number of continuous retransmissions prior to 
        dropping a TCP connection) and SOCKTCPTOTRXMTVAL (allows 
        setting the maximum continuous time spent retransmitting
        without receiving an acknowledgement from the other
        endpoint)
      + Added support for parameter PTCPIPFILTERTCPPORTS allowing to
        limit shared TCP ports when round-robin is enabled via
        PTCPIPFILTERKEY.
    (SOLN 10-100824-2685)
   
155. [H01^AAU] 
    Added new parameter INTERFACEOUT for use of a specific
    local interface even when the interface the SSH2 process is
    listening on is unspecific. If parameter INTERFACEOUT is not
    set, then the value of INTERFACE is used (or 0.0.0.0 if that
    is not configured either). The values of INTERFACE and
    INTERFACEOUT must be valid for the TCP/IP process accessed by
    SSH2.

156. [H01^AAU] 
    Previously, the collector configured via LOGEMS was opened and
    closed for every log message. This is not always required 
    according to the EMS manual. A new boolean SSH2 parameter
    LOGEMSKEEPCOLLECTOROPENED was added to keep the collector
    configured via LOGEMS open.
    (No SOLN)
   
157. [H01^AAU] 
    Added support for stopping a session via SSHCOM command
    ABORT SESSION. This will only be allowed for users with
    full SSHCOM access.
    (No SOLN)
   
158. [H01^AAU] 
    Added support for session statistics. These can be enabled via
    new SSH2 boolean parameter ENABLESTATISTICSATSTARTUP (default:
    false) or via new SHCOM command ENABLE STATISTICS. Statistics
    can be disabled again via SSHCOM command DISABLE STATISTICS.
    The status of the statistics can be displayed using SSHCOM
    command STATUS STATISTICS. The actual statistics counters and
    rates can be displayed via STATISTICS SESSION command. For   
    STATISTICS the shortcut STATS can be used instead. Only users
    with full SSHCOM access will be allowed to issue the 
    ENABLE/DISABLE STATISTICS commands.
    (No SOLN)
   
159. [H01^AAU] 
    Added SSHCOM command EXPORT HOST-KEY that allows exporting the
    public key part of the host key stored in the HOSTKEY file.
    
    This feature was added in version 0090.
    (No SOLN)
   
160. [H01^AAU] 
    Added SSHCOM command INFO HOST-KEY showing details of the host
    key stored in the HOSTKEY file.
    
    This feature was added in version 0090.

161. [H01^AAU] 
    The private user keys now support a key life cycle, allowing a
    user to define a time interval for which a key can be used.
    Parameter LIFECYCLEPOLICYPRIVATEUSERKEY controls if a key life
    cycle is disabled (value DISABLED, which is the default) or 
    enabled. The key life cycle can be enabled by setting the
    parameter to either FIXED or VARIABLE. FIXED means that a
    standard user (without full SSHCOM access) is not allowed
    to change the key life cycle, while value VARIABLE allows any
    user to modify the key life cycle. Key life cycle states include
    PENDING, LIVE, and EXPIRED. The key life cycle state cannot be
    set directly but is determined from new KEY attributes LIVE-DATE
    (not valid before date) and EXPIRE-DATE (not valid after date).
    In addition to these two new KEY attributes, the time a key was
    generated or imported is held in attribute CREATION-DATE.
    Existing SSHCOM client-mode commands GENERATE KEY, ALTER KEY,
    and IMPORT KEY now support the two KEY attributes LIVE-DATE and
    EXPIRE-DATE.
    If parameter LIFECYCLEPOLICYPRIVATEUSERKEY is FIXED or VARIABLE,
    but no LIVE-DATE and EXPIRE-DATE has been specified with the
    GENERATE KEY and IMPORT KEY commands, then the values for 
    LIVE-DATE and EXPIRE-DATE are calculated using intervals 
    defining how long a key stays in PENDING state after creation or
    import, and how long a key stays in LIVE state. The length
    of the first interval in days is defined by new SSH2 parameter
    INTERVALPENDINGPRIVATEUSERKEY while the second interval in days 
    is defined by new SSH2 parameter INTERVALLIVEPRIVATEUSERKEY.
    
    This feature was added in version 0090.

    A configuration file named SSHMCFG has been added for exclusive
    use by $ZSSP0 and $ZSSP1 configured for the maintenance stacks.
    It has its own SSHCTL database and log files.
    The original SSHCFG file can now be used for SSH2 processes
    configured for public LANs, but keep in mind that this file
    will be overwritten with the installation of a new RVU. A backup
    should be kept in case changes have been made. The SSHMCFG file
    will also be overwritten, but should not have been changed by
    the user. Please see the note in the Non-Std Info section
    regarding back-out to a pre-AAS release.

    SFTP[OSS]/SFTPSERV: The record delimiter  for parameter
    RECORDDELIMITER can now be set to values "LF", "CR",
    "CRLF" or "ANY". If the value is set to "ANY", then any
    delimiter (LF, CRLF, or CR) is seen as record delimiter in data
    received from a remote client. Records sent will be delimited
    with LF (default for parameter RECORDDELIMITER) if the parameter
    is set to "ANY".
    (SOLN 10-100902-2894)
   
164. [H01^AAS] 
    Added support for finer security granularity in client mode.
    Introduced parameter CLIENTMODEOWNERPOLICY defining the
    policy how to set the owner of an entry. Defined values are:
    
      A. LOGINNAME - the default owner is the login name. An alias
         user cannot add/read/manipulate entries for the Guardian
         user the alias is configured with. A Guardian user can 
         add/manipulate entries for that Guardian user.
         The value LOGINNAME is recommended if different people are
         using the various aliases configured with the same
         Guardian user.
    
      B. GUARDIANNAME - the default owner is the Guardian user,
         independent of the logon name being an alias or a Guardian
         user. Entries are read using the Guardian user only.
         This was the default before this enhancement, and needs to
         be used if the previous client mode policy should be kept.
    
      C. BOTH - the default owner is the login name but a Guardian 
         user can add or manipulate entries under an alias or a 
         Guardian user. Entries are read for both the login name and
         the Guardian user in case these are different (entries of
         the alias are read first, then entries of the Guardian ID).
         The value BOTH is only recommended if a Guardian
         user and all aliases configured for this Guardian user are 
         solely used by one person.
         The default value for CLIENTMODEOWNERPOLICY is BOTH.
         Please be aware that the default client mode policy changed
         from GUARDIANNAME to BOTH with this release. This change of
         the default value will not cause problems with existing
         records because records had been read in previous releases
         only if stored under the Guardian user (entries stored
         under an alias had been ignored).
    
      The following will change when using the new default value or
      value LOGINNAME:
    
      If a user is logged on as an alias and new client mode records
      are added (PASSWORD, KNOWNHOST, PUBLICKEY), then the new
      records will be stored under the alias name. An alias user is
      not allowed to add records for the underlying Guardian user
      when CLIENTMODEOWNERPOLICY is set to LOGINNAME.
    
      The processing of the client mode SSHCOM commands has been
      enhanced to support the new CLIENTMODEOWNERPOLICY values
      LOGINNAME, GUARDIANNAME, and BOTH. If the value is set to
      either LOGINNAME or BOTH, the following applies:
    
      1. Entries can be added with alias user names. A user logged
         on using an alias can only display, add, and manipulate
         entries for that alias.
      2. A Guardian user can display, add, and manipulate entries 
         for the Guardian user.
      3. Depending on the rules explained in the following paragraph,
         a group manager can add, change, or delete client mode
         records stored under an alias or Guardian name.
      4. A user with full access can add/manipulate all entries
         unless an OBJECTTYPE USER record says otherwise.
    
      If parameter CLIENTMODEOWNERPOLICY is set to value
      GUARDIANNAME, then the following applies:
    
      1. Any attempt to add entries under an alias name will be
         rejected. Entries will be added under a Guardian name.
      2. A Guardian user can display, add, and manipulate entries
         for the Guardian user.
      3. Depending on the rules explained in the following paragraph,
         a group manager can add, change, or delete client mode
         records stored under a Guardian name.
      4. A user with full access can add/manipulate all entries
         unless an OBJECTTYPE USER record says otherwise.
    (SOLN 10-100902-2897)
   
165. [H01^AAS] 
    Added support for OBJECTTYPE USER Safeguard records. This
    affects the processing of MODE DAEMON commands/records,
    but it also changes the control over MODE CLIENT
    commands/records as well.
    
     1. DAEMON MODE commands:
    
        If a thawed OBJETTYPE USER record exists, then a user is 
        allowed to execute a critical command only if the user has
        CREATE (C) authority on the OBJECTTYPE USER access control
        list. If user super.super is denied the CREATE (C)
        authority, super.super is not allowed to execute critical
        commands. Parameters FULLSSHCOMMANDGROUPn
        and FULLSSHCOMMANDUSERn are ignored if a thawed OBJECTTYPE
        USER record exists.
    
        If no OBJECTTYPE USER record exists or if the existing
        OBJECTTYPE USER record is frozen, then the rules existing
        in previous versions of SSH2 apply: the user super.super 
        can execute any commands. The parameters
        FULLSSHCOMMANDGROUPn and FULLSSHCOMMANDUSERn are evaluated.
    
     2. CLIENT MODE commands:
    
        If an OBJECTTYPE USER record exists, the person executing an
        SSHCOM CLIENT MODE command affecting records for a specific
        Guardian user or alias <user-or-alias> must either be logged
        on as <user-or-alias> or meet these two qualifications:
        a) Have CREATE (C) authority on the OBJECTTYPE USER access
           control list.
        b) Be the owner of the underlying Safeguard user ID of
           <user-or-alias> or be the group manager of the owner of
            the underlying Safeguard user ID of <user-or-alias>.
    
        If an OBJECTTYPE USER record does not exist, the person
        executing an SSHCOM CLIENT MODE command affecting records
        for a specific Guardian user or alias <user-or-alias> must
        either be logged on as <user-or-alias> or meet these two
        qualifications:
        a) Be the group manager of the underlying Safeguard user ID.
        b) Be the owner of the underlying Safeguard user ID of

166. [H01^AAS] 
    Added a new feature that allows restricting a user to connect
    only from one remote host at any given time. A remote host is
    identified by its IP address. A new user attribute
    ALLOW-MULTIPLE-REMOTE-HOSTS was added (default value: YES).
    If set to NO for a specific user, then new connections of that
    user will be rejected if the user has already established a
    connection from a different remote host. Existing sessions of a
    specific user will not be stopped when the attribute
    ALLOW-MULTIPLE-REMOTE-HOSTS is altered from YES to NO for that
    user.
    The restriction will be applied by all SSH2 processes accessing
    the same SSH2 database.
    Outgoing connections are not affected by the new user attribute.

    If SAFEGUARD is configured with PASSWORD-REQUIRED ON, SSH2 
    will now use the password provided by the user to 
    impersonate an ALIAS. Additionally, you can set the SSH2 
    parameter SAFEGUARD-PASSWORD-REQUIRED TRUE. SSH2 will then 
    always request users mapped to an ALIAS to perform password 
    authentication even after a successful public key 
    authentication, to have a valid password
    for impersonating the SAFEGUARD ALIAS.

    HP NonStop SSH now supports keyboard-interactive 
    authentication from remote SSH clients, mapping it to the 
    standard system user authentication dialog verifying the 
    user name and password, as well as taking care of exception 
    events such as password expiry. 
    
    The default setting of the ALLOWEDAUTHENTICATIONS parameter 
    is now (password,publickey,keyboard-interactive), causing 
    new users to be added via AUTOADDSYSTEMUSERS TRUE with 
    keyboard- interactive enabled. The ALLOWED-AUTHENTICATIONS 
    attribute of existing user is not changed. To enable 
    keyboard- interactive authentication for existing users, use 
    the SSHCOM ALTER USER command.
    
    Note: this new feature allows the proper handling of 
    password change messages over the SSH encryption protocol. 
    In order to make use of that feature, the SSH2 client must 
    support keyboard-interactive authentication as well.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SSH2 parameters SSHAUTOKEXBYTES and SSHAUTOKEXTIME configured 
    with very low values potentially causes a performance 
    degradation of the ssh2 process.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    When configuring SSH2 parameters SSHAUTOKEXBYTES and 
    SSHAUTOKEXTIME much lower than the default values of 1Gb and 
    3600s respectively suggested by RFC 4253. SSH2 therefore needs

    SYMPTOMS: 
    FTPlist() in an SFTPAPI application did not return the maximum
    specified buffer size.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    The actual output produced by the listing of files in a directory
    is larger than the limit specified in the FTPlist() call, i.e.

    Ensure that all SSH2 processes that use the same audit file
    configuration are listening on the same port, i.e. are equally
    active.
    Without restarting the SSH2 processes with a new configuration:
    Rename the open audit files or enforce switching the open files

18. [H01^ACE]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    A process may have an incorrect "login-name" reported by TACL
    STATUS < process>,DETAIL or by the PROCESS_GETINFOLIST_
    attribute 82, and in the Session Userid field of KSL records.
    This can be the STN process itself, an ELP (external login
    process) started by STN, or a dynamic service application
    process started by STN. The problem only affects the
    login-name attribute, and is entirely cosmetic. The incorrect
    login-name is always an alias, never a Guardian group.userid.
    In all cases the PAID (process access id) is correctly set to
    the proper Guardian group and user id. There are no known
    cases where the login-name is used for any authentication
    purposes.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    There are two requirements: 
    (1) the STN process was started from a TACL logged on with an 
    alias, or a dynamic session was recently started using an alias,
       -and- 
    (2) a subsequent dynamic session made use of the SERVICE 
    attribute LOGON NONE.
    
    This problem even applies to the typical TACL application when
    started as an STN service but not when started by SSH. However,
    since TACL users generally logon immediately the problem is
    only visible for a short time.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Rare. Most STN configurations do not exercise this defect.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    There are no workarounds to clear the login-name of the STN or
    ELP processes.
    
    There is a workaround for the application processes started by 
    STN. Use the STNCOM command:
    ADD SERVICE ....,LOGON NONE,USER < Guardian group.user>
    LOGON NONE without the USER attribute starts the application as
    PAID (0,0), which is commonly configured as NULL.NULL. This
    causes the incorrect login-name to be inherited by the new
    process. By specifying USER GROUP.USER, STN or ELP will call
    USER_AUTHENTICATE_ using the specified Guardian userid. This
    clears the login-name attribute for STN or ELP, and the new
    process will inherit the blank login-name. Any Guardian
    group.user can be used here, even NULL.NULL.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    STN and ELP now call USER_AUTHENTICATE_ (SUPER.SUPER) to clear
    the login-name attribute before starting dynamic service
    applications with LOGON NONE and no USER attribute specified.

    CONDITIONS: 
    When long output is produced via an EXEC command (without PTY 
    allocation).
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always under the listed conditions.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Explicitly request a PTY by specifying option -t for an OpenSSH 
    client.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The defect repair makes sure that any buffered output is sent 
    to the client even after the process executing the command 
    terminates and stdin/stdout of that process is completely 
    processed.

20. [H01^ACD]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    The SSH client hangs.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Executing an EXEC request with the SSH client on NonStop 
    establishing a back-to-back connection (e.g. using localhost 
    127.0.0.1) on a fast multi-IPU system using an input variable 
    (INV) containing superfluous data, i.e. data that is neither 
    needed for authentication nor as a remote command.
        Example:
            #PUSH v
            #SET v some text
            SSH/INV v/ usr@host whoami
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Sometimes under the listed conditions.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Remove the superfluous data from the input variable.
    If no further input is needed, another option is to specify IN 
    without a file name,
        e.g. 'SSH/IN/ usr@host whoami'.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The SSH2 process now correctly handles the specific scenario of 
    superflous data received from the ssh client after the remote 
    side already closed the ssh channel created for the EXEC request.

21. [H01^ACD]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): STN object would fail to startup with the

    *** RLD ERROR ***: Unresolved Text Symbol 
    FS_COMMFILE_WRITEREAD64_ in file \<node>.$SYSTEM.ZSSH.STN. 
    
    Since STN is generally started from $ZZKRN, the above messages 
    may not be readily observed. In this case, the observed symptom 
    is failure of $ZPTY startup ($ZZKRN may display EMS events). 
    To confirm, the problem, start STN from a TACL prompt using 
    a test process name: 
    run $system.zssh.stn / name $stn99 / 
    
    If the RLD messages appear, the process is not started. If 
    nothing appears, then STN started ok and the problem does not 
    affect your configuration. Use BREAK to get the TACL prompt 
    back and STOP $STN99.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): The STN39 message, displayed when the 
    application terminates the session, did not end with CR LF. In 
    some cases, subsequent display lines could be appended to the 
    end of the STN39 line, causing confusion. 
    This is a cosmetic problem.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Session closed by application (rather than at the terminal 
    emulator), and the terminal emulator does not otherwise start 
    subsequent displays on a new line.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Will occur for certain terminal emulators.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    None.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The STNCOM command STN39 has been enhanced, and the new default 
    is to end with CR LF, STN39 N | Y | | NOCRLF 
    
    The STN39 command controls display of the STN39 message when the
    application terminates the session. An application can terminate
    the session by sending control 12 (see C12_ALWAYS) or by 
    closing all opens to the STN window. In the event of the last 
    opener closing the terminal, STN waits 3 seconds 
    (see AUTODEL_WAIT) to allow for an immediate reopen of the 
    window (e.g. Pathway). 
    The message takes two forms: 
    STN39 Session terminated - application request (control 12) 
    mm/dd hh:mm 
    
    STN39 Session terminated - application closed terminal 
    mm/dd hh:mm 
    
    The STN39 command is then applied: 
    STN39 N No message; session is terminated immediately. 
    STN39 Y (Default) STN39 message displayed plus CRLF. After 
    another 5 seconds the session is terminated. 
    STN39 NOCRLF (compatible with STN B37 and earlier) STN39 
    message displayed without CRLF. After another 5 seconds the 
    session is terminated.

27. [H01^ACD]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): When using PARAM EMS^FILE to specify an 
    alternate EMS collector, events generated before detecting this 
    PARAM were only sent to the $0 collector. This would leave some 
    events, including the STARTUP event, missing from the alternate 
    collector. There also was no way to completely suppress EMS 
    events, and no way to change the EMS file for a running STN 
    process.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    PARAM EMS^FILE <$alt-coll> specified at startup.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    To avoid missing events, do not use PARAM EMS^FILE. 
    To suppress all EMS events, use PARAM EMS^FILE $NULL 
    (requires that $NULL be running).
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    New startup DEFINE switches to the alternate EMS collector 
    before any EMS events are generated. 
    DEFINE =EMS_FILE,<alt-collector> 
    This define should specify a running EMS collector. Two special 
    values: $NULL and $NONE both completely suppresses EMS events. 
    STN does not even open these files so no process $NULL or 
    $NONE need be running. 
    
    For other names, STN first generates the standard startup event 
    to the $0 collector. STN then opens the specified process. If 
    the open encounters an error, STN generates an EMS warning 
    event: 
    STN Open error on DEFINE =EMS_FILE <filename> fe=<error>, 
    will use $0 
    and then continues to use $0 for all events. 
    If the open succeeds, STN generates one final event to $0: 
    STN switch to alternate EMS collector from 
    DEFINE =EMS_FILE <filename> 
    This serves to notify the main console log that future STN 
    events will use the alternate location. STN then repeats the 
    startup event, this time to the alternate collector, and 
    subsequently continues to use the alternate collector. 
    PARAM EMS^FILE may continue to be used; it may even be 
    used together with DEFINE =EMS_FILE, but that is of 
    questionable utility. PARAM EMS^FILE now also supports 
    $NULL and $NONE. 
    
    A new STNCOM command allows the EMS collector to be changed 
    at any time: 
    EMS_FILE <filename> 
    
    If the file cannot be opened, EMS_FILE is not changed. 
    If EMS_FILE was previously open, a final event is written 
    to it: 
    $STN Switching to EMS collector <filename> 
    
    The old EMS collector is closed and the following event 
    is sent to the new EMS collector: 
    $STN STN B41 17Nov2016 - changed EMS collector 
    
    The current setting of EMS_FILE, regardless of how it was 
    set, is displayed by INFO STN.
    
    The EMS file can be changed at any time by the STNCOM
    command EMS_FILE:
    
    EMS_FILE <file>
    
    <file> has the same interpretation as for DEFINE =EMS_FILE.

28. [H01^ACD]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): STN performance for all users can be degraded 
    by higher priority application processes. This can even result 
    in one application effectively blocking a higher priority 
    application.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    STN running at the same or lower priority than any application, 
    especially if STN is running at the same or lower priority than 
    a typical TACL.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    May occur.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Alter STN proces priority. This may require the use of SCF 
    ALTER PROCESS $ZZKRN.xxx commands.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    STN now displays the following EMS zstn-evt-misc 9 at startup 
    time if running below priority 160, e.g. 149: $STN 
    STN running at priority=149, recommended minimum priority=160 
    
    When starting a process for a dynamic service session, STN 
    will reduce the priority specified by SERVICE PRI and 
    DYNAMIC_PRI so that it is at least one less than STN's priority. 
    
    The STN priority is also displayed by INFO STN, including a 
    warning if it is lower than 160.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): The following EMS zstn-evt-application-loop 
    1018 may occur more often than is necessary (example): 
    $ZPTY 0,1079 $SYSTEM.SYSTEM.SCF is looping on window #ZWN0142
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Hitting a break key to obtain a TACL prompt while EDIT is running
    can produce the error in less than a minute. Terminating a 
    session will sometimes produce this message about looping, 
    depending on the application.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Sometimes.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Setting STNCOM command REPLY_DELAY_MAX to large values will
    reduce the frequency of the warning; setting it to 0 will 
    eliminate the warning. However, using 0 removes protection 
    against problematic applications which are inappropriately 
    looping on terminal i/o errors.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    STN now waits for 60 consecutive I/O errors before generating 
    the EMS event. With the default REPLY_DELAY_MAX, this is about 
    2 minutes; for EDIT, which delays retries for 1 second, this 
    is about 3 minutes. The EMS event still only appears once per 
    session.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    A connection was rejected under specific conditions, based on 
    the case of the external ssh user name.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    The external ssh user name matched the name of a USER entry in 
    the SSH database if compared case-insensitively but did neither 
    match the configured SYSTEM-USER nor the corresponding alias 
    name in Safeguard, when compared case-sensitively. This caused 
    inconsistent behaviour. 
    Example scenario: Assume two SSH USER records, one with a user 
    name that is equal to an existing alias in Safeguard, the other 
    with a different name. Both USER records are configured with 
    attribute SYSTEM-USER set to a Safeguard alias name: 
    USER SYSTEM-USER 
    Safeguard Alias user1 user1 user1 test-a user2 user2
    
    If the ssh user name 'User1' was specified on the client side, 
    then the connection was rejected. However, if the ssh client 
    user name 'Test-a' was used, the connection was accepted.

    CONDITIONS: 
    Some ssh clients do not allocate a PTY by default for EXEC

    it is possible to explicitly suppress PTY allocation when a PTY 
    would otherwise be allocated by default, e.g. when requesting a

    file. The new data was written starting at position 0 as 
    expected, i.e. at the beginning of the file, but the EOF 
    position was the EOF of the original file, not corresponding to 
    the amount of newly written data. If the size of the new file was
    less than the size of the existing file, then the file contained
    new data plus data from the original file. 
    No problem occurred if the new file was larger or equal in size 
    compared to the original file.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    If new file contained less data than the original file.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Remove the target file before transferring the new one. Use 
    SFTP for file transfer instead of SCP.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The SCP object now explicitly sets the truncate flag for system 
    call open().

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): After an SSH session with a Guardian SSH 
    client was terminated, the message STN39 was displayed, 
    immediately followed by the TACL prompt. The prompt was 
    concatenated with the STN39 message instead of being separated 
    by a CR/LF.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Normal operation.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The STN39 message now includes a CRLF option to position the
    cursor to the next line.  This ensures that the next output
    from the terminal emulator or SSH client is displayed on a new
    line instead of being appended to the end of the STN39 message.
    
        STN39     N | Y | NOCRLF
    
    The STN39 command controls the display of the STN39 message 
    when the application terminates the session.   An application 
    can terminate the session by sending control 12 (see 
    C12_ALWAYS) or by closing all opens to the STN window.  When the
    last opener closes the terminal, STN waits 3 seconds (see 
    AUTODEL_WAIT) to allow for an immediate reopen of the window
    (e.g. Pathway). The message takes two forms:
    
    STN39 Session terminated
                   - application request (control 12) mm/dd hh:mm
    
    STN39 Session terminated
                   - application closed terminal mm/dd hh:mm
    
    The STN39 parameter is then applied:
    
    STN39 N         No message; session is terminated immediately.
    
    STN39 Y         (Default) STN39 message displayed plus CRLF.  
                     After another 5 seconds the session is 
                                 terminated.
    
    STN39 NOCRLF    (compatible with STN B37 and earlier) STN39
                     message displayed without CRLF.  After 
                     another 5 seconds the session is terminated.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTPSERV processes did not stop in the situation where changing 
    to the initial folder was unsuccessful and the SSH session was 
    disconnected.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    The initial folder could be incorrectly configured 
    (Safeguard USER attributes GUARDIAN SUBVOLUME or 
    INITIAL-DIRECTORY or the SSH USER attribute 
    SFTP-INITIAL-DIRECTORY set to an invalid value) 
    or the correctly configured folder was no longer available
    (e.g. OSS FILESET not STARTED).
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Somewhat likely.
   
    SIDE-EFFECTS: 
    Many SFTPSERV processes did not stop and this led to high memory 
    usage and ultimately could cause the user's application to fail.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    Adding a user with RESTRICTION-PROFILE would fail and produce an 
    error message indicating the RESTRICTION-PROFILE "one" did not 
    exist.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    ADD the USER without RESTRICTION-PROFILE and then ALTER the USER 
    and include the attribute RESTRICTION-PROFILE.

84. [H01^ABV]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTP client might report an error or SFTP server might 
    reject some mixed path format descriptions.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Parameter SFTPALLOWGUARDIANCD not set to TRUE 
    and a hybrid Posix/Guardian path or filename is specified 
    e.g. /G/$vol.subvol.file.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Highly likely.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Avoid using hybrid format path descriptors.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The parameter SFTPALLOWGUARDIANCD with value set to
    TRUE has been added to the configuration files SSHCFG and 
    SSHMCFG to ensure the Guardian format for paths is enabled.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTP file transfers, which worked previously, fail.   
    Sometimes error 4002 is seen in the audit file.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    If SFTPSERV related parameters were configured in CONFIG 
    or CONFIG2 configuration files only, these parameter values 
    were not known to the SFTPSERV processes.
    This was because parameters SFTPCONFIG and SFTPCONFIG2, 
    relevant for SFTPSERV processes (processing incoming SFTP 
    sessions) had to be configured in the SFTPCONFIG and 
    SFTPCONFIG2 configuration files or via PARAMs or in the SSH2 
    startup parameters.  These requirements are described in the 
    SSH reference manual.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Specify CONFIG and CONFIG2 as the values for SFTPCONFIG 
    and SFTPCONFIG2, respectively.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The values of CONFIG and CONFIG2 are now used as the 
    default value for SFTPCONFIG and SFTPCONFIG2, respectively,
    which restores the behavior to that observed previously.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    An SFTP client reports that it is unable to perform a file 
    transfer.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Parameter SFTPALLOWGUARDIANCD and other SFTPSERV related
    parameters were not read from CONFIG/CONFIG2 at startup of 
    SFTPSERV.
     
    Error 4002 may be seen in the audit log.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Very likely.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    This defect has been corrected by ensuring parameter
    SFTPALLOWGUARDIANCD and other SFTPSERV related
    parameters are read at startup from CONFIG/CONFIG2 if 
    SFTPCONFIG/SFTPCONFIG2 are not explicitly set.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    Previously supported path formats for folders and files used by 
    SFTP clients were no longer accepted, e.g. /G/$vol.subvol.file 
    or $vol.subvol.file (if parameter SFTPALLOWGUARDIANCD is set to 
    TRUE) or /G/$vol/subvol.file.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    If hybrid pathnames were specified using part POSIX and part 
    Guardian format.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Use format /G/vol/subvol/file 
    or 
    $vol.subvol.file (if parameter SFTPALLOWGUARDIANCD is set to 
    TRUE). 
    The latter of the two workaround formats above may not work if 
    the current default folder is not in the Guardian name space 
    (e.g. /tmp).
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The defect, which was introduced in T0801H01^ABP, has been 
    corrected.
    
    All hybrid combinations of path formats for folders and files
    are now supported.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    Using capitals (upper case), or mixed case letters for a 
    subsystem specified in an SSH client command fails.  
    E.g. ssh -e none -p 22 -v vts@10.226.12.207 Tacl
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Whenever the subsystem specified was not purely in lower case 
    characters.  Only when all lower-case character were used, 
    would the command succeed.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Specify the subsystem only using lower case characters.

112. [H01^ABP]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY):  Control 11 and 12 requests received while a 
    session was active could be deferred for an indefinite time by 
    other outstanding I/O requests, especially a read operation. 
    Applications expecting an immediate response would treat 
    the delay like a session termination.  After the other 
    application eventually stopped, the session would terminate 
    instead of returning control back to XygateAC and its associated 
    TACL.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    With Xypro XygateAC software, using the CHECKCONNECT option 
    where another application (like bash) was active on the terminal.
    The timeout would cause XygateAC and its associated TACL to stop.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Likely.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    If another process has the terminal in break-only mode 
    (e.g: an outstanding TACL prompt), then a file error 110 is 
    returned, otherwise file error 0 (normal) is returned.
    The recommendation is that XygateAC CHECKCONNECT be disabled.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTPSERV incorrectly processed SFTP commands 'rename' and 
    'remove', where the file referenced was a symbolic link. 
    Instead of the symbolic link being renamed or removed, the 
    underlying file was affected.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Symbolic link being the object of a 'rename' or 'remove' command.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Before this fix the symbolic link was resolved to the underlying 
    file and the requested operation was executed for the underlying 
    file. The fix ensures that for the 'rename' command the symbolic 
    link file is renamed and for the 'remove' command the symbolic 
    link file is removed, rather than the underlying file.

    In some cases the processing was correct, i.e. the access was 
    appropriately rejected but the corresponding log message 
    contained the wrong remote IP address, which was the IP address 
    of the already existing connection of the same user.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    [SFTP API] The interactive prompt for storing a password in the
    SSH2 database was not suppressed for ssh/sftp clients 
    controlled by applications via the SFTP API interface.
    This problem was introduced in T0801^ABK where it is now required
    to enter a valid character sequence as a response to the prompt
    "Add password for <user@ipaddr:port> to the password
    store (yes/no)". When an invalid or empty response
    is detected, the prompt "Please type yes or no at
    the prompt in next line" is displayed. Prior to T0801^ABK, an
    invalid or empty response would result in accepting the input
    with the assumption that "no" was entered. This change caused
    problems with an HP/OSM LowLevelLink application for loading 
    updated firmware to a CLIM.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Using the SFTP-API interface with password authentication.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    One of the following steps can be used to avoid the password
    store prompt altogether:
    a) setting SSH2 configuration parameter ALLOWPASSWORDSTORE to
    FALSE.
    b) using an SSH/SFTP client once interactively 
    to store the password in the database. Then this stored
    password is used for API based connections for the same user,
    and a prompt is not sent to the application.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    For the SFTP API, the password prompt is now suppressed.
        
    This fix was implemented in SSH version 97b and has also been
    included in TCFs T0801^ABN and T0801^ABO.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): In certain cases, the Guardian version number
    was reported incorrectly by Guardian procedure
    PROCESSOR_GETINFOLIST_ (item 60), leading to an STN abend.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Using newer versions of NonStop SSH on older OS versions and
    SSH sessions configured with *MENU* or Telnet sessions using a
    SERVICE with LOGON REQ.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Unlikely.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    New STNCOM command UAIPADDR was added to control the inclusion
    of the workstation remote IP address on USER_AUTHENTICATE_ calls.
    This IP address is included in certain Safeguard records.
    UAIPADDR should only be used on Guardian releases H06.26 
    (or later) or J06.15 (or later). Using the parameter on earlier
    releases will cause an abend of the STN process and a ZZSA dump
    file created in the STN object file subvol. STN formerly used 
    PROCESSOR_GETINFOLIST_ items 3 and 60 to retrieve the Guardian 
    version number, but in certain cases the reported version number
    can be incorrect, leading to an STN abend.
    
       UAIPADDR    Y | N
    
    UAIPADDR N (default) omits the IP address on USER_AUTHENTICATE_
    calls. Safeguard records will not include the IP address. 
    This can safely be used on all Guardian releases.
    
    UAIPADDR Y includes the IP address on all USER_AUTHENTICATE_
    calls without regard for the Guardian version. Safeguard
    records will include the IP address. If UAIPADDR Y is used on
    Guardian releases earlier than H06.26 or J06.15, STN will abend.
    
    NOTE: On Guardian Gxx releases (S-Series hardware), STN never
    includes the IP address on USER_AUTHENTICATE_ calls regardless 
    of UAIPADDR setting.
    
    NOTE: STN only calls USER_AUTHENTICATE_ for (a) SSH sessions
    configured with *MENU* and (b) Telnet sessions using a SERVICE 
    with LOGON REQ.
    
    The workaround fix using UAIPADDR was included in STN version
    B25. Note that a fix is also planned for Guardian procedure
    PROCESSOR_GETINFOLIST_ in H06.29/J06.18. See also related

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): Commands with long responses (>=250,000 bytes)
    caused STNCOM and SSHCOM to loop indefinitely. This occurred for
    instance when SSHCOM command INFO USER *, DETAIL was issued and
    more than approximately 200 users were configured. This number
    of users can vary depending on the size of the data required
    for parameters specified for each user.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Command INFO USER *, DETAIL with large number of users
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Unlikely
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Issue several commands with wildcards, i.e. INFO USER b*, DETAIL
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Commands with long responses no longer cause SSHCOM or STNCOM
    to loop; instead, the response is now processed "on the fly", 
    and lines are sent to the current OUT file as they are received.
    No large buffer to hold the data is needed as before.
    
    This problem was initially fixed in STN version B23, but a
    buffer was still used in that fix and if the limit was exceeded
    the message "Response truncated" was displayed 
    (TCF T0801^ABL). 
    
    Note that this fix is listed here for TCF T0801^ABJ which has 
    been recalled. The initial fix is now in TCF T0801^ABL (version

    The missing success message like "OK, user <user-name> added"
    was the only hint that the command failed.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY):  SSH sessions with *MENU* and an SSH Guardian 
    system user in group.user format that did not match SERVICE USER
    were not terminated as expected. Instead, the STN15

    STN trace files are now secured "OOOO" and CLEARONPURGE to
    better protect any sensitive data. Trace files, which are
    created by explicit STNCOM command or a PARAM at STN
    startup, contain all data to and from the remote terminals,

    In this case the part before the dot was correctly interpreted as

    FIX-INFO: 
    The SPI interface was enhanced to better support 
    NonStop ASAP.
    
    STATUS PROC now reports STARTED when no listeners are configured
    which is the normal case with NonStop SSH.
    
    STATUS PROC response is now encased in a datalist.  This avoids
    NonStop ASAP "SPI error 0".
    
    Response for SPI INFO WIN for SSH sessions will fill IPv6 fields
    for IPv6 sessions and fill IPv4 fields otherwise. The
    determination is made by examining the contents of the
    rem-ip-address and loc-ip-address fields of the pty-req from SSH.
    
    Other minor adjustments to SPI responses have been made, not
    related to any problem reports.
    
    SPI support in STN is still limited to the commands used by
    NonStop ASAP. These commands can also be used from SCF, but
    this is not recommended. STNCOM is required for all

    2. Including duplicate commands
    3. Including unknown commands

    FIX-INFO: 
    Now, if a string is given instead of a number, then all commands
    in the history list are displayed that match the string.
    Support of different history modes for the SFTP client was
    added.
    
    The new parameter HISTORYMODE can be set to TACL or SFTP.
    Main differences: In SFTP mode, FC and HISTORY with string 
    is looking for the given string anywhere in the command, while 
    in mode TACL the search string must be the beginning of
    the command to result in a match. In SFTP mode, duplicates as
    well as the HISTORY and HELP commands will not be added to the
    history list, while in TACL mode these commands as well as
    duplicates are added. In TACL mode, the number assigned to a 
    command stays the same until the command drops out of the 
    history list. In SFTP mode, the number of a command can change.
    This happens whenever an old, duplicate command is moved to the
    top, and the old command is removed.

    LIKELIHOOD:

    FIX-INFO: 
    The REPLY_DELAY_MAX command has been re-instated with some
    changes. REPLY_DELAY_MAX is the maximum delay time, in seconds,
    for an STN reply to an I/O error. An I/O error is defined as 
    application I/O to the terminal (read, write, etc.) which results
    in an STN reply with non-zero fecode (140, 110, etc. write, 
    etc.). This protects against poorly coded applications that
    hard-loop on I/O errors, consuming a cpu. 
            
    The reply to the first I/O error after a normal I/O is not
    delayed; the second consecutive error is delayed for 0.01 second.
    The delay time is multiplied by 4 for successive errors up to 
    REPLY_DELAY_MAX seconds. The first time this limit is reached
    for a session, the following EMS event is generated:
            
       zstn-evt-application-loop 1018 
       <stn-proc> <appl-proc> <progfile> is looping on window

        $ZPTY \T.$X1G4 $SYSTEM.SYSTEM.TACL is looping on window
        #ZWN0001
            
    REPLY_DELAY_MAX defaults to 2 seconds, and values from 1 to
    60 are allowed. REPLY_DELAY_MAX 0 disables the feature, which 
    means a looping application and STN can consume 100% of a cpu.

    version 0089, existed still in version 0090, and was fixed in
    version 0091.
    
    Please note: For ASCII files written to an OSS file, the remote
    SFTP clients must still convert CRLF, CR or any other delimiter
    to LF before sending records to the SFTP server (SFTPSERV) on 
    NonStop. There is no way for the SFTP client to indicate ASCII
    mode transfer to the server in the SFTP protocol. Only the 
    Guardian file attributes appended to file names in the
    Guardian name space can be used to indicate that the target file
    is an EDIT file.
    
    The problem has been fixed in SSH version 0091.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): A dedicated window was not always available
    for connection to a new remote session request, even if there 
    was no active open from any application to that window.
   
    CONDITIONS:

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): STATIC windows lost their associated SERVICE
    name after a backup takeover. As a result, the session would not
    re-connect unless the window was first deleted and then added
    again. This problem was introduced in STN release B11
    (SPR T0801^AAY).
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Re-connect of static windows after takeover.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTP when controlled via SFTPAPI did not return the statistics
    line "<n> bytes transferred in <t> seconds" at the end of
    a transfer. When not using SFTPAPI, this line had always been
    returned and printed with enabled progress meter.

    SFTP when controlled via SFTPAPI now shows the statistics line
    at the end of a transfer.

274. [H01^ABA]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    For SSH2 user parameters CPU-SET and SFTP-CPU-SET, the first
    selected CPU was always the first CPU of the configured CPU set.
    This did not provide an efficient cpu distribution 
    in case that many users were configured with the same CPU set,
    and if these users rarely started processes.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The starting point for the round-robin selection of CPUs within
    the allowed CPU set specified via USER attributes CPU-SET and
    SFTP-CPU-SET is now chosen randomly. This new logic will better
    distribute the user processes.
    
    The new logic also applies to the global default SSH2 
    parameters CPUSET and SFTPCPUSET added in SPR T0801^ABA.
    
    The enhancement was implemented in version 0091.
    (No SOLN)
   
275. [H01^ABA]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    There was no support for a global default parameter to set the
    range of cpus for processes directly invoked by SSH2 (except
    SFTPSERV processes) in the absence of CPU-SET specifications for
    users.  Likewise, there was no support for a global default
    parameter for SFTPSERV processes in the absence of SFTP-CPU-SET
    specifications for users.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Parameters CPUSET and SFTPCPUSET have been added, serving as
    default values when the respective USER attributes CPU-SET and
    SFTP-CPU-SET have not been set. If CPUSET or SFTPCPUSET are 
    specified via PARAM, the parameter value must be enclosed
    within double quotes if it contains commas.
    
    Note that the starting point for the round-robin selection of
    CPUs within the allowed CPU set specified via CPUSET and
    SFTPCPUSET is chosen randomly.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTP/SFTPOSS: There was no support for a HISTORY command and 
    command line numbering in the SFTP client.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The command "HISTORY" has been added that shows all commands
    previously issued in the session.
    HISTORY <cnt> displays the last <cnt> commands of the history
    list. Duplicate commands are not listed, neither is the
    FC command and the HISTORY command itself. Commands that resulted
    in an error are not included. 
    
    The enhancement has been implemented in version 0091.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTP/SFTPOSS: There was no support for a fix command (FC) 
    in the SFTP client.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Support for a fix command (FC) was added. FC <num> retrieves
    the command with number <num> assigned in the history command
    list. Just FC retrieves the last command. FC <str> retrieves the
    command containing string <str>, starting the earch at the last
    command.
    
    FC starts fix command editing by displaying '...' on the next
    line. After the user is finished with editing and types "Enter",
    the modified command is executed, unless '//' was entered, which
    ends fix command editing without execution.
    
    Note that the '!<num>' command is not supported because of a
    conflict with '!' being reserved for shell command execution. 
    Command 'FC <num>' can be used instead of '!<num>'.
    
    The enhancement has been included in version 0091.

    FIX-INFO: 
    New STNCOM command DYN_CPU (cpu,cpu) now can be used to specify
    a CPU for these type of processes. The default is
    DYN_CPU (0,15).

    SYMPTOMS: 
    The alphabetic order of commands listed in the SFTP help was not
    preserved. The lcd command is listed next to cd, and exit
    is listed next to pwd.
   
    CONDITIONS:

    SFTP[OSS]: A double backslash was not accepted in the node name
    part of Guardian filenames and subvolumes. This is 
    incompatible with FTP where it is accepted.
    
    Also, when lcd is specified as $vol.subvol.filename, the
    filename is used as a subvolume. An error should have been
    displayed.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Double backslash in node names, for instance when using lcd
    command.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    A double backslash is now accepted. Note that a single

    characters.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    AUDITFILE parameter with EMS collector.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Now a collector for audit messages can be specified via new
    parameter AUDITEMS, and the message format can be configured
    via AUDITFORMATEMS (with default 0). Using AUDITEMS ensures
    that long audit messages are split into multiple messages with
    event number 1005 if audit text is continued in the next message
    and with event number 1004 for the last (or only) part of the
    audit text (i.e. similar to what is done for log messages
    written to EMS when configured via parameter LOGEMS).

    This is fixed now. Prerequisite is that objects SSH2, SFTPSERV
    and STN are added to Safeguard with PRIV-LOGON (via SAFECOM
    command ADD DISKFILE <obj>, PRIV-LOGON ON).
    
    For SSH authenticated sessions using STN service with LOGON REQ,
    USER_AUTHENTICATE_ option bits have been adjusted to avoid a

    FIX-INFO: 
    The NBOT_TIMEOUT command has been reinstated with a new default
    of 8 seconds, and with a new action.  When NBOT=Y, if STN can
    not open or writeread a select ready message to a Terminal
    Helper ($ZTTnn), after NBOT_TIMEOUT seconds STN will send a 
    Posix SIGQUIT (control-\) to the application. Setting 
    NBOT_TIMEOUT to zero disables the feature, usually meaning the
    application will hang until the Terminal Helper finally 
    responds. The signal can occur promptly after NBOT_TIMEOUT 
    expires, but can be delayed as much as 60 seconds.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    When backing out from SPR T0801^AAS (and later) to a pre-AAS
    release using DSM/SCM, the server processes $ZSSP0 and $ZSSP1
    would not start.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Back out to pre-AAS release.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Not likely.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The startup parameter for processes $ZSSP0 and $ZSSP1 has been
    modified in the ZSSHGP file for SPR T0801^AAS, and now points to
    configuration file SSHMCFG instead of SSHCFG in the ADD process
    section and a new ALTER process section. If a user
    has already installed T0801^AAS via DSM/SCM and needs to back
    out to an earlier SSH version, also installing it via DSM/SCM,
    the $ZSSP0 and $ZSSP1 processes will not start because their
    startup parameter definition points to configuration file
    SSHMCFG which does not exist in pre-AAS releases. The ZSSHGP
    file in earlier versions does not contain an ALTER section,
    and the process add commands in the ADD section fail because the
    process definitions already exist.
     
    To overcome this problem, the user first needs to issue
    an "SCF delete process $zzkrn.#SSH-ZTCP*"command,  then run
    "zmodgp zsshgp" from $system.zssh, and start the processes via
    "scf start process $zzkrn.#SSH-ZTCP*".

    FIX-INFO: 
    A new parameter SUPPRESSCOMMENTINSSHVERSION was implemented.
    If set to TRUE, the SSH2 version string is not sent in the SSH
    protocol version string. The format of this SSH protocol version
    string is (reference RFC 4253, section Protocol Version 
    Exchange): SSH-protoversion-softwareversion SP comments
    (followed by CR LF). The SSH2 version string is sent as comment
    if parameter value is false; otherwise the 'comments' part 
    (including the separating space character SP) is suppressed.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    There was no support for SFTP related audit messages for

    FIX-INFO: 
    Audit messages for outgoing SFTP connections were added.
    The format is similar to that for incoming connections, but
    <SESSION-LOG-ID> for outgoing connections is the sftp client

    *MENU* SERVICE which in turn was configured in STNCOM with
    LOGON REQ, without a PRIV-LOGON ON setting in Safeguard,
    and an older version of Safeguard, the session was terminated
    with  "STN18 Unknown userid or incorrect password provided by 
    SSH not valid".
   
    CONDITIONS:

    FIX-INFO: 
    The STN object file needs to be configured
    under SAFECOM in certain cases by performing the following
    command at STN installation time:
    
       SAFECOM ADD DISKFILE STN,PRIV-LOGON ON
    
    This is only of concern when (a) an alias is used to logon to an
    SSH session; (b) that alias is configured in SSHCOM with
    *MENU* SERVICE; (c) that service is configured in STNCOM with
    LOGON REQ. With PRIV-LOGON ON, the application is started as
    logged on to the alias. Without PRIV-LOGON ON, and on older
    version of Safeguard, the session is terminated with
    
      STN18 Unknown userid or incorrect password provided by SSH
      not valid

    FIX-INFO: 
    STNCOM/SSHCOM now allow "&" (ampersand) as a continuation
    character. When "&" appears as the last character on a line,
    the command is continued with the first column of the next line.
    There is no limit on the number of lines over which a command
    may be continued, but commands are limited to a total of 1024
    characters. If STNCOM is prompting at a terminal for input, the
    prompt for continuation lines will be the current prompt 
    prefixed by (ampersand ampersand space): "&& ". Continuations

    WELCOME, as well as ADD commands for listeners, services,
    windows (types STATIC, SU, and DEDICATED only), scripts, and
    ipranges. ADD commands will span multiple lines using "&"

    NBOT Y|N
    
    The default "Y" sets bit<11> in the misc flags field in replies

    Note that if a log file already exists, and a subsequent log file
    is created, the new log file inherits the security settings
    of the existing log file. This feature was introduced in

    SYMPTOMS: 
    On a NonStop Blades system with a stopped CLIM, the SSH2 listen
    would fail as expected, but every 10 seconds a retry occurred
    causing a new socket to be allocated which was not closed.
    Eventually the process ran out of FCBs (File Control Blocks),
    and an error 34 was returned (unable to obtain an FCB) when a
    client tried to access SSH2.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    CLIM in STARTING state (after it was stopped) and SSH2
    configured for the associated subnet ($ztcp0 or $ztcp1).
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Likely
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Use alternate subnet
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The problem has been fixed and the socket is now properly 
    closed after the error.
    
    The fix has been included in SSH version 0088.

    internally after detection of an error exception.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    For the new OS-Bundle available in H06.21/J06.10, an SSH license
    is no longer required, and the license check needed to be
    removed.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Removed license check for TNS/E. The license file is still read
    to retrieve the customer string which is used to encrypt the
    SSH2 database. If the license file is removed, the parameter
    CUSTOMER must be set instead to be able to access existing
    databases (value for CUSTOMER must be the value of
    license entry SSH2.customer).

369. [H01^AAQ]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    There was no support for SFTP exclusion modes for structured 
    file reads. For instance, having an EXCLUSIVE option ensures that
    the open for read fails if any process has already opened the
    file for write.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    SFTSERV/SFTP[OSS]: Added support for parameter
    SFTPEXCLUSIONMODEREAD. Valid values are SHARED, EXCLUSIVE, and
    PROTECTED. The value is used during read of structured files
    (determines exclusion mode of FILE_OPEN_). Default value
    is SHARED. Setting this parameter to EXCLUSIVE ensures that the
    open for read fails if any process has already opened the file
    for write.
    
    The enhancements have been added in SSH version 0088.

370. [H01^AAQ]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    There was no support for allowing configuration of TCP/IP socket
    options on a socket level.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Support was added to allow configuration of TCP/IP socket
    options on a socket level. The keep-alive setting can be defined
    via parameter SOCKETKEEPALIVE (value 0 or 1, default 1). The 
    size of the TCP/IP send/receive buffer can be set via
    parameter SOCKETSNDBUF/SOCKETRCVBUF, respectively.
    
    Previously, the socket options were either hard-coded (keep-alive
    on) or always used the values configured in the TCP/IP process
    (send/receive buffer size). A value of 0 for SOCKETSNDBUF and 
    SOCKETRCVBUF (which is the default) indicate that the size of
    the send/receive buffer is defined by the TCP/IP process
    configuration.
    
    The enhancements were added in SSH version 0088.

371. [H01^AAQ]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    There was no  support of SFTP transfer modes for structured
    files, transparent transfer of records, and  unstructured
    transfer.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Added support of additional SFTP transfer modes for structured
    files, transparent transfer of records (fully supported between
    NonStop only) and  unstructured transfer (unstructured file
    access of structured files for read only). 
    
    The previously existing transfer mode (transfer of records with
    end-of-record delimiter) is still the default.
    
    The transfer mode is indicated by a character added to the file
    name, separated by a comma, similar to the file attributes.
    The following indicators are used: d (delimited record),
    t (transparent record), and u (unstructured). The unstructured
    transfer mode corresponds to the file structured file access of
    FTP (binary transfer of structured files).
    
    The file attributes can be added after the transfer mode, for
    example: put a1910,t z1910te,t,e,541,128,128,16,4072
    for a transparent transfer of an entry-sequenced file from
    NonStop to NonStop server. Example for unstructured transfer,
    e.g. using a Unix sftp client: get a1910,u a1910.

    FIX-INFO: 
    [GFTH38] STN uses the IN parameter for the user to specify an
    edit-101 file. This file contains only PARAM commands, and other
    commands are ignored. Please refer to the manual under
    GFTCOM^OBJECT and GFTCOM^IN for further details.
    
    The IN parameter may be used with or without PARAM GFTCOM^OBJECT.
    When IN is not specified, it defaults to the home terminal and
    STN startup continues normally without any "IN" processing.
    
    If the IN parameter specifies $ZHOME, the following EMS event
    zstn-ems-evt-misc 9 is now generated:

    RECORDDELIMITER which can be set to either LF or AUTO (default
    is LF). If the value is LF, then only LF can be used as the
    delimiter. If the value is AUTO, any of the three sequences LF,

    to value LF; i.e. customers who used CR or CRLF as record
    delimiter must now set the parameter to a value of AUTO.

405. [H01^AAO]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    It was not possible to configure allowed subsystems on a global
    basis, i.e. per SSH2 process (or multiple SSH2 processes) via a
    parameter in the configuration file.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Support for global configuration of allowed subsystems was
    added. The parameter ALLOWEDSUBSYSTEMS can be used to restrict
    the SSH user settings to those subsystems listed in the value
    for ALLOWEDSUBSYSTEMS, which is a comma separated list of
    subsystems. If a subsystem is not mentioned in both the
    global list (SSH2 parameter ALLOWEDSUBSYSTEMS) and the SSH
    user's attribute ALLOWED-SUBSYSTEMS, then the subsystem request
    will be denied.
    
    Currently, the only supported subsystems are SFTP and TACL.
    Note that when ALLOWEDSUBSYSTEMS is used in the configuration
    file, the value must be specified without parentheses. When used
    as a PARAM, and a list of more than one subsystem is given,
    the list must be enclosed in double quotes.

406. [H01^AAO]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    Sensitive SSHCOM commands could only be executed by super.super.
    A feature was missing that allows granting administrative 
    SSHCOM command privileges to users other than super.super.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Support for configurable full access of all SSHCOM commands was
    added. Before this enhancement, only super.super could execute
    critical commands. Now, groups or users can be defined that take
    over the role of an SSH2 administrator.
    
    Admin users are defined via the parameter set 
    FULLSSHCOMACCESSUSER<i> where <i> is a number between 1 and 99.
    The parameters must be set contiguously, i.e. if one parameter
    FULLSSHCOMACCESSUSER<k> is not defined, the checking of
    FULLSSHCOMACCESSUSER<i> parameters stops. Similarly, the admin
    groups can be defined via parameter set FULLSSHCOMACCESSGROUP<j>.
    If neither of these parameters are set, only super.super can
    execute the critical commands, as before. Allowed values for
    FULLSSHCOMACCESSUSER<i> are logon names in the form of 
    "group-name.user-name", but no logon ids (and no alias names).
    For FULLSSHCOMACCESSGROUP<j>, only group names are allowed.

407. [H01^AAO]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    It was not possible to specify edit line numbering in 
    increments smaller than 1 for Guardian edit files when using
    an SFTP client.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Support for decimal incrementing of Guardian edit file
    line numbers was added. Previously, all Guardian edit files were
    written starting with line number 1 and increment 1.000, which 
    allows a maximum of 99999 lines. This behavior is still the
    default.
    
    If the new parameter SFTPEDITLINESTARTDECIMALINCR is set to a
    value of 0 to 99999999 (line number times 1000), then the
    decimal incrementing starts after the specified line was reached.
    The line number increment can be set via a second new parameter
    SFTPEDITLINENUMBERDECIMALINCR. The value of this parameter is
    1000 times the increment. Example: 1000 means 1.000 (which is
    the default value) and 3 will increment the line numbers by 
    0.003. Setting SFTPEDITLINESTARTDECIMALINCR 0 and 
    SFTPEDITLINENUMBERDECIMALINCR to 1 allows for the maximum
    possible number of lines in Guardian edit files.
    Setting these parameters to 40000000 and 100, respectively, will
    create line numbers similar to the ftp server (increment by 0.1
    after line 40000).
    
    A third parameter called SFTPEDITLINEMODE controls the handling
    of lines that are longer than 239 characters. Possible values 
    and their meaning are the same as for the FTP server command
    aslinemode: "none" (i.e. error), "cut" and "wrap".
    
    The new parameters are only used when writing a Guardian edit
    file, i.e. when a put command was sent from an ssh client on the
    network connected to NonStop (server mode) or when a get command
    was issued at the NonStop SFTP or SFTPOSS client prompt (client
    mode). In client mode, the parameters must be set as PARAMs in 
    the TACL environment where SFTP is started, or as environment
    variables in the OSS environment where SFTPOSS is started.
    
    The enhancements have been added in version 0086j.

    FIX-INFO: 
    The file security of the current log/audit file is now used for 
    the next log/audit file during rollover processing, instead of
    the default security (super.super). A difference to
    the previous processing will only be seen if the file security
    of the current log/audit file is manually changed

    SYMPTOMS: 
    There was no SSH2 parameter and command line option that allowed
    restriction of possible client authentication methods.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    A new SSH2 parameter CLIENTALLOWEDAUTHENTICATIONS now allows 
    restriction of possible client authentication methods. 
    The value is a comma separated list of supported authentication
    methods. Previously, all supported methods were always allowed 
    (actual list of tried methods depends on methods supported
    by the remote server). Default value: all authentication methods
    supported by SSH2.
        
    Also, there now is option "AllowedAuthentication" for clients. 
    The value is a list of authentication methods the user who
    is starting the client wants to allow for the specific client
    run. Example:
        
      ssh -S $x -oAllowedAuthentications=publickey,password usr@host
        
    The default value for this client side option is the value set by
    SSH2 parameter CLIENTALLOWEDAUTHENTICATIONS.
        
    The authentication methods allowed at the client side consist
    of those methods that are specified in the client side option 
    "AllowedAuthentications" as well as in the value of

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTP file transfers using "mput" with a wild card caused the

    was no option to have the file names upshifted.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    SFTP file transfers with mput wildcard.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    A new parameter SFTPUPSHIFTGUARDIANFILENAMES was added. It can
    be set as PARAM for SFTP, as environment variable for SFTPOSS
    (outgoing SFTP connections), and as a new SSH2 parameter as well,
    used by SFTPSERV for incoming SFTP connections.
        
    If the parameter is set to TRUE, Guardian file names will appear
    upshifted. Therefore, when using "mput" in the SFTP client, the 
    source file name or file name template must be in upper case, 
    else a "file not found" error is returned. 
        
    Similarly, when connecting to a SSH2 instance started with the
    new parameter set to TRUE, all Guardian file names or file name
    templates used in a "mget" command must be in upper case.
        
    The parameter's default is FALSE, and in that case the behavior
    is the same as before the parameter was added. If "mput" with a 
    wildcard is issued, the source file name template has to be
    in lower case, and the filenames also appear in lower case in the
    target directory.

       <$pname> IN file=<in-file> <error-message>
        
         <in-file> is from STN's startup message.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): EMS event zstnems-evt-misc identifying the 
    STN PARAMs was not generated at STN process startup.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    STN process startup.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    (GFTH34) EMS event zstn-ems-evt-misc 9 is now generated at

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): EMS event zstnems-evt-pool-used (1033)
    was not generated when buffer pool usage exceeded 80%.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    PARAM POOL_SIZE not large enough for heavy STN load.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    An EMS event zstn-evt-pool-used (1033) was added when pool
    usage goes above 80%, or back down below 80%.
        
     <$pname> STN Buffer pool used <2> <3>% , used=<4>kw size=<5>kw
        
        <2> is "OVER" or "UNDER"
        <3> is the threshold percentage as sent by the POOL_WARNING
            command (default 80)
        <4> is the current amount of memory used (unit=1024 words)
        <5> is the total size of the pool (unit=1024 words) as
            configured by PARAM POOL_SIZE
        
    Every minute STN checks the pool usage; if the percentage has
    changed from over to under the warning level, or under to over,
    the EMS message is displayed.  The EMS message is also displayed
    once at startup time. Due to fragmentation, usage cannot reach
    100%, and 80-90% is usually the maximum.  Use the POOL command
    to monitor pool usage.  For larger configurations, increase 
    PARAM POOL_SIZE.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): The STN02 Services menu was repeated instead
    of disconnecting after an error occurred following the response
    to the Service menu Enter Choice prompt.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): Sometimes EMS event 1028 ("STN Window #ZWNxxx
    stopping process") showed an error 509. This event is generated
    after dynamic window deletion which is automatic at session
    disconnect time.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    KILL^DYNAMIC=Y, OSS shell or TACL started by SSH, session
    disconnected at workstation.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always occurs for given conditions.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    When KILL^DYNAMIC=Y (default is N), upon dynamic window deletion
    (which is automatic at session disconnect time), STN will stop
    the process which STN originally started for the dynamic service
    window.  The problem was that STN confused an SSH session where
    $SSH started the TACL or OSH, and tried to stop a process that
    it had not started. In some cases it was able to stop the
    process, in others the process would stop before STN tried
    to stop it, resulting in process_stop_ error 590. No harm done
    except for the error 590 in the EMS event. There is always an
    EMS event 1028 when KILL_DYNAMIC=Y, but most of the time it
    shows status 0 (normal). The error (590) will no longer occur.
        
    This fix was implemented in STN version A99.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    A timeout (error 40) was reported by an SSH client when
    multiple SSH clients were invoked and parallel requests sent
    to a remote Unix system. The problem surfaced in the HP lab 
    when at least 8 multiple disk firmware updates were initiated
    through OSM and sent to one or more CLIMs.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): An error resulting from a write to EMS caused
    an abend to occur.
   
    FIX-INFO:

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (Pseudo-TTY): 6530 Line Mode terminals did not reliably
    autoswitch to VT100 mode when the OSS applications (including
    shell) started up.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    6530 Line Mode terminals will now more reliably autoswitch to
    VT100 mode. This improves operation when the default shell is 
    used without "set -o vi" in the profile.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    Large buffer sizes used by the SFTP client, either specified via
    -B option or by default (SUN OS), caused error 21 when writing to
    a Guardian binary file. This occurred sporadically only.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (Pseudo-TTY): The STN process was not started as a non-stop
    pair after applying the startup script zsshgp.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The line "ADD PROCESS $ZZKRN.#SSH-ZPTY, (PARAM BACKUPCPU ANY)"
    was added to the startup script ZSSHGP for the SSH-ZPTY process.
    This will cause STN to be started as a process pair, while still
    defined as a persistent process. After a primary cpu failure,
    the backup will now take over which is faster then a primary

    SYMPTOMS: 
    An option for adding a user like an existing user was not 
    available with the SSHCOM ADD USER command.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    A new ADD USER option "LIKE <existing-user-name>" was added. 
    When specified, the new user record is first initialized with
    the values taken from the <existing-user-name> user record.
    Then the new user name and any other attributes specified in
    the ADD USER command are applied before the new user record is
    added. If the ADD USER command does not include a
    SYSTEM-USER attribute, then the new user name is used as
    SYSTEM-USER as well unless the SSH2 parameter
    USETEMPLATESYSTEMUSER is true (in that case the new user record
    will get the value for the SYSTEM-USER attribute from the
    <existing-user-name> user record).
        
    This option is available in SSH version 0084.

478. [H01^AAL]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    There was no option to control the SSH2 behavior when the SSH
    user name could not be found in the SSHCTL data base.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    A new parameter DISCONNECTIFUSERUNKNOWN was added to control the
    SSH2 behavior when the SSH user name could not be found in 
    the SSHCTL data base (default value is false to preserve
    previous behavior). If true, the session will be
    disconnected immediately with the message "Access denied".
    Otherwise, SSH2 reverts to the previous behavior: it sends back
    the list of all supported authentication methods (this avoids
    returning the information that the user does not exist). Both
    options are mentioned in RFC 4252.
        
    This parameter is available in SSH version 0084.

479. [H01^AAL]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    There was no control option for SFTP[OSS] and SSH[OSS] clients
    to prompt for supplying a user name instead of defaulting to the
    user who started the client. This default behavior occurred when
    the client was started with only the host argument instead of
    username@host.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    SFTP[OSS] and SSH[OSS] clients now prompt for the username if
    PARAM/environment variable INQUIREUSERNAMEIFNOTSUPPLIED is set
    to true and the username is not specified (i.e. host instead of
    username@host is supplied as argument). If the value is false
    or not defined, the default user name is chosen as before 
    (default name is the name of user who started the SFTP[OSS]
    or the SSH[OSS] client).

    FIX-INFO: 
    Control-x (hex 18) now echoes @ CR LF (hex 40 0d 0a) whenever
    6530 Line Mode is not enabled, regardless of ECHO setting. This
    is now compatible with Telserv and fixes a problem with CTT IXF

    SYMPTOMS: 
    Adding users with the same (dummy) Guardian user ID or *NONE*

    FIX-INFO: 
    Boolean parameter USETEMPLATESYSTEMUSER was added. The
    SYSTEM-USER of the template user (configured via
    AUTOADDSYSTEMUSERSLIKE) is used for an automatically added user
    if USETEMPLATESYSTEMUSER is true (only of interest
    in case AUTOADDSYSTEMUSERS is set to TRUE and
    AUTOADDSYSTEMUSERSLIKE is configured). This allows adding users
    with the same (dummy) Guardian user ID or *NONE*. The default
    behavior (USETEMPLATESYSTEMUSER is false) is to set
    the SYSTEM-USER attribute of the automatically added user to the
    same value as the SSH user name.

    *MENU* <service> or *MENU* <#window>.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    A new option FORCE for USER attributes CI-PROGRAM and
    SHELL-PROGRAM was added when set to *MENU* <service> or *MENU*
    <#window>. The new option can be added to force the use of the
    configured service/window. It can be used with the CI-PROGRAM
    parameter (for 6530) or SHELL-PROGRAM (for non-6530) sessions, 
    for instance:
        
       CI-PROGRAM *MENU* RESTACL FORCE

    Attribute value: Number of characters per line, valid range:
    10-237. The lines in output files created by EXPORT SSHCTL will
    be wrapped and the last character will be "\" if a width is

    SYMPTOMS: 
    Specific cpus could not be assigned for processes started by
    SSH2.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    In order to restrict non-SFTPSERV user processes to specific
    cpus, a new USER attribute CPU-SET has been added. The value is
    a comma separated list of cpu numbers or cpu ranges, enclosed in
    parenthesis. The default is to start the user processes in the
    same cpu as the SSH2 process is running in (spreading load by
    using multiple SSH2 processes and starting these SSH2 processes
    in different cpus).
    
    A new USER attribute SFTP-CPU-SET was added, having the same
    format as CPU-SET but only used for SFTPSERV processes started
    by the SSH2 process for the user.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    User processes started by SSH2 (other than SFTPSERV processes)

    FIX-INFO: 
    A new USER attribute PRIORITY was added. All user processes
    started by SSH2 directly will have the configured priority
    assigned. Default value is -1, which was used in previous
    versions, meaning the user processes will have the same priority
    as the SSH2 process.

495. [H01^AAJ]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    There was not sufficient capability for restrictions on incoming/
    outgoing user connections.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    A new object and record type RESTRICTION-PROFILE was added. It
    contains parameters for additional checks restricting incoming
    and outgoing user connections. The main attributes are
    CONNECT-FROM, CONNECT-TO, PERMIT-LISTEN, PERMIT-OPEN, and 
    FORWARD-FROM.
    
    CONNECT-FROM is a list of patterns used to match the address or
    name of a client system connecting SSH2. The format of each 
    pattern and the pattern matching done using the value
    of CONNECT-FROM is corresponding to handling of parameter 
    from= in OpenSSH (with the difference that '~' is used instead
    of '!' and the use of standard host names instead of canonical
    host names).
    
    While CONNECT-FROM relates to incoming connections, the
    attributes CONNECT-TO and PERMIT-OPEN are related to outgoing
    connections. Each contain a list of <host>:<port range> pairs
    (no patterns allowed). For checks related to outgoing 
    connections, the Guardian user name is taken to look up the 
    USER record to retrieve the RESTRICTION-PROFILE record.
    
    If set, the attribute CONNECT-TO restricts a user to the
    configured host/port combinations when starting an outgoing
    connection using clients SSH, SSHOSS, SFTP and SFTPOSS.
    
    Attribute PERMIT-OPEN corresponds to the OpenSSH parameter
    permitopen=. If set, the attribute PERMIT-OPEN restricts a user
    to the configured <targethost>:<targetport> specified in local
    forwarding requests. If localhost or 127.0.0.1 is specified as
    <targethost> in command ssh -L <localport>:<targethost>:
    <targetport> <user>@<host> then the specified <host> is used for
    restriction checking.
    
    The attribute PERMIT-LISTEN allows restricting the forwarding
    ports a user can specify in forwarding requests.
    
    The attribute FORWARD-FROM can be used to define which hosts can
    use forwarding tunnels opened by a specific user.
    
    New commands ADD, ALTER, DELETE and INFO RESTRICTION-PROFILE
    have been implemented.
    The command EXPORT SSHCTL now exports the RESTRICTION-PROFILE
    records to a file RESTRICT.
    No restrictions apply by default in case a user is not found in
    the SSHCTL database. This can happen for outgoing connection
    restrictions when the SSHCTL user does not match the Guardian
    user (the Guardian user name is used to look up the SSHCTL user
    record).A new SSH2 parameter called RESTRICTIONCHECKFAILEDDEFAULT
    allows to fail all connection restriction checks if a user
    record for the Guardian user could not be found.
    
    A new USER attribute ALLOW-GATEWAY-PORTS was added that can be
    used to prevent users from creating gateway ports. When creating
    a forwarding tunnel, the ssh option -g can be specified and the
    local listen is not done on localhost (loopback 127.0.0.1) but
    on all subnets. If a USER is configured with ALLOW-GATEWAY-PORTS
    NO any attempt to specify -g will be rejected by SSH2.
    
    A new USER attribute RESTRICTION-PROFILE was added which can be
    set to the name of an existing RESTRICTION-PROFILE record.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTP/SFTPOSS did not support interactive authentication
    before reading the batchfile in case the -b option was specified.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    SFTP/SFTPOSS were modified to do authentication interactively
    before reading the batchfile in case the -b option was specified.
    Previously, input for authentication was read from the batchfile.
    Now the authentication phase is done interactively and only then
    the commands will be read from the batch file. The previous
    behavior is still available by using IN (Guardian)
    or < (OSS).

    There was no support for a Guardian attribute separator
    within SFTPSERV other than comma.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Support for GUARDIANATTRIBUTESEPARATOR within SFTPSERV was added.
    First character of value (which should only consist of one 
    character) is used as separator character between Guardian file
    name and Guardian file attributes. Default: comma.
    Either the configured separator or the standard separator 
    (comma) is supported but not a mix of both.

    FIX-INFO: 
    Support for user attribute SHELL-ENVIRONMENT (used to set
    environment variable ENV) was added. 
    ENV is interpreted/executed by the shell, see man pages.
        
    This is important for non-login-shells, which are started without
    executing /etc/profile or ~/.profile. The attribute value
    (shell script) can contain absolute paths but also pre-defined
    values like $HOME or ~.

    FIX-INFO: 
    Support for SCP server was added, but not yet for SCP client.
        
    Important hints:
      + The SCPOSS object must be available in OSS name space under
        the name scp and must be found via the PATH environment
        variable. This can be achieved by creating a symbolic link
        to the installation location, e.g.
        ln -s /G/system/zssh/scposs /usr/bin/scp
      + The ENV user attribute must be set to ensure the PATH

    TCPRESOLVERNAME will still overwrite the corresponding DEFINE
    set externally in the process context (as before). A DEFINE for
    TCP/IP process name is created from the SUBNET parameter if no

    SYMPTOMS: 
    An SSH2 process name DEFINE was not available for newly
    started shells and TACL command interpreters.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    A DEFINE "SSH2^PROCESS^NAME" was added for newly started 
    shells and TACL command interpreters. The DEFINE value is the
    name of the SSH2 process that started the shell/TACL. 
    The SSH clients (objects SSH, SSHOSS, SFTP and SFTPOSS) make use
    of this DEFINE to look up the SSH2 server process before the CPU
    dependent lookup using SSH2PREFIX is tried. Those SSH clients
    running within a shell started by a SSSH2 server process no
    longer require specifying the SSH2 server process via the -S
    flag. Shells now have an environment variable 
    SSH2_PROCESS_NAME containing the same value as the 
    define =SSH2^PROCESS^NAME.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    Non-6530 shell channels could not be connected to a menu,

    FIX-INFO: 
    Non-6530 shell channels can now be connected to a menu, specific
    service, or window provided by the STN PTY server. This
    enhancement is similar to the previously implemented support of
    *MENU* for CI-PROGRAM. Now a non-6530 terminal session will be
    connected to the PTY server and a pre-defined menu is shown if
    SHELL-PROGRAM is set to *MENU*. The non-6530 session is directly
    connected to a service or window if the SHELL-PROGRAM
    value consists of "*MENU*" and a service name or a window name
    directly following the "*MENU*".
        
    Example:
        
        > SSHCOM <ssh2 process name>
        % ALTER USER menuuser, SHELL-PROGRAM *MENU*
        % ALTER USER serviceuser, SHELL-PROGRAM *MENU* service1
        % ALTER USER windowuser, SHELL-PROGRAM *MENU* #window1

    STN (pseudo-TTY): If a session (a) was started by SSH with
    CI-PROGRAM set to *MENU* and CI-SYSTEM-USER not set to *NONE*,
    or (b) has LOGON REQ, the logon was not propagated to the
    application, resulting in a duplicate or unnecessary logon
    request from the application (for instance, TACL).
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The application is now started with process_setinfo_ option 70,1 
    (propagate logon). This allows for a single authentication and
    expedites session startup.

507. [H01^AAH]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): For SSH sessions with USER configured for
    CI-PROGRAM *MENU*, STN did not interpret CI-SYSTEM-USER. 
    For SERVICEs with LOGON REQ, this resulted in STN prompting
    the workstation for the userid and password.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    STN now uses the CI-SYSTEM-USER when it is present, bypassing

    SYMPTOMS: 
    An abnormal termination of  a Guardian-based channel server 
    process (e.g. by executing a STOP on an SFTPSERV process) 
    during data transfer sometimes caused an abnormal termination 
    of SSH2.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    It was not possible to specify a timeout value for SFTP
    sessions.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Idle timeout handling within SFTPSERV is now supported via 
    a new parameter SFTPIDLETIMEOUT (value is the number of seconds).
    If this parameter is set to a number greater than zero and the
    SFTP user is idle for the specified time, then the SFTPSERV
    process stops processing SFTP commands.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): There was no ADD SERVICE parameter to specify
    the maximum number of active sessions for a DYNAMIC service.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    ADD SERVICE LIMIT now specifies the maximum number of active
    sessions for a DYNAMIC service. The default is zero (0) which
    allows any number. The limit is a number in the range 1-9999.
    If a dynamic service is requested and the specified number of
    sessions is already active, the request is rejected with the
    message:
    
        STN74 Dynamic Service Session Limit exceeded

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): ADD SERVICE USER was not fully implemented.
    It did not allow specification of a user ID in name format.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    ADD SERVICE USER now permits userids in name format (group.user)
    as well as numeric:
    
        ADD SERVICE ,USER <group.user> | (xxx,yyy)
    
    LOGON REQ is automatically set when USER is specified.
    
    If the username entered at the STN15 prompt does not match the
    USER parameter, the session is terminated with the message:

515. [H01^AAH]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): STN did not support RESILIENT services similar
    to what is provided in Telserv. Some customers who want to 
    transition from TELSERV to SSH require this feature; for
    example, for "emergency" Tacl access.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    STN now supports RESILIENT services. RESILIENT services require
    TYPE DYNAMIC and LOGON REQ; USER can optionally be used to
    restrict access to a specific userid. A RESILIENT service is
    configured simply by defining the service:   
    
            ADD SERVICE RESTACL,TYPE          DYNAMIC
                               ,RESILIENT     YES
                               ,PROGRAM       $SYSTEM.SYSTEM.TACL
                             [ ,MENU          HIDDEN ]
                             [ ,USER          SUPER.SUPER ]
                             [ ,PRI           199 ]
                             [ ,LIMIT         3 ]
    
    The default for the RESILIENT parameter is NO. There is no need
    to configure windows. Since RESILIENT is often used for 
    "emergency TACL access", it is often run at high priority,
    restricted to super, and hidden on the STN02 service menu.
    
    The first session that requests a RESILIENT service will
    dynamically create a new window and launch the specified
    program.  This is the same as any other DYNAMIC session, except
    that the following message is displayed:
    
        STN70 No existing window available for resilient
        service, window #ZWNnnnn added.
    
    When a RESILIENT session is terminated, the application program
    is not stopped, no error code (140, 60, etc.) and no BREAK is
    sent, and no SIGHUP is sent. In fact, any active application
    I/O request is left outstanding indefinitely.
    
    When a subsequent session requests a RESILIENT service, if there
    are any windows left from a previous session of that service,
    the new session will be immediately connected to that existing
    window. The application will generally repeat its prompt, but
    otherwise the session resumes exactly where it left off. For
    example, a TACL will still be logged on and have its environment
    intact. This is one reason why LOGON REQ is used to authenticate
    all users requesting a RESILIENT session.
    
    Specific handling upon session resumption:  For block mode 6530,
    the terminal is placed into block mode and error 191 is returned
    to the application. This forces most block mode applications to
    refresh the display. EDIT XVS will allow for session recovery.
    For conversational (ITI), if a Guardian application read or 
    writeread is pending, it is completed with febreak 111. For 
    TACL and most other applications this repeats the prompt.
    For OSS (posix) reads, fesigint 4523 is returned. For /bin/sh 
    and most other applications, this repeats the prompt. If no 
    read is active, then Guardian break or OSS SIGINT is generated,
    again generally resulting in a new prompt.
    
    If a RESILIENT service is requested and there are no available
    pre-existing windows from prior sessions, then a new window is
    added and a new program launched. Thus connection will be 
    immediately made to an existing window (and program) when
    possible, but if necessary a window and program will be
    automatically created.
    
    The STN implementation of RESILIENT is different from Telserv
    in several aspects:
    
       SERVICE TYPE DYNAMIC
    
       No ADD WINDOW command.  Windows are dynamically created as
       needed. STN does not restrict a RESILIENT service to a single
       window, simplifying configuration. SERVICE LIMIT may be used
       to control the maximum number of simultaneous sessions.
    
       6530 Block mode applications (EDIT XVS, TEDIT, Pathway) are
       handled cleanly.
    
       OSH (Posix) applications are handled cleanly.
    
       Multiple Guardian applications (for example, a FUP or SCF
       prompt started from a TACL) are handled cleanly.
    
    When a RESILIENT session is resumed, several startup messages
    display the exact status:
    
       STN70 Reconnecting to resilient window #ZWNnnnn.
             Last access: <time>
       STN70 application $Y1G7 $SYSTEM.SYS00.TACL
       STN70 application 1,175 $SYSTEM.SYS00.FUP
    
    The application line is repeated for each opener of the window,
    including process name, cpu/pin, or posix pid, and the object
    file name. This helps clarify exactly what is running in the
    resumed session. The STN70 messages immediately precede
    application output.
    
    STATUS WIN indicates RESILIENT. State CONNECTED means the window
    is in session with a remote terminal client; STARTED means 
    waiting for a new session. Indicating RESILIENT avoids 
    confusion when seeing a dynamic window (#ZWNnnnn) that is not
    connected, because non-resilient dynamic windows are deleted
    when the session is disconnected.
    
    Note:
    
    DYNAMIC service applications are now started with 
    process_setinfo_ option 71,1 (Propagate Stop On Logoff) when
    RESILIENT is NO. When RESILIENT is YES, option 71,0 
    (do not propagate) is used. In most cases, this will have 
    little effect since applications generally stop anyway when the
    dynamic window is deleted.
    
    The above enhancements were made in STN release A85.

    be erased (for 6530 terminals) and the following message
    appears:
    
       STN39 Session terminated - application closed terminal <time>
    
    This message will be displayed for several seconds, then the
    session will terminate.
    
    Note that the purpose of AUTODEL_WAIT is to allow a "grace time"
    during which an application can re-open the terminal without
    having the session terminated.  Some applications close and 
    re-open the terminal in this manner. 6530 terminals will always
    be left in conversational (ITI) mode.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): Sessions terminated by an application 
    control-12 request did not erase the terminal screen 
    and did not display a message (6530 only).
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Sessions terminated by an application control-12 request now
    erase the terminal screen (6530 only) and display:
    
        STN39 Session terminated - application request (control 12)
        <time>
    
    This message will be displayed for several seconds, then the
    session will terminate. After session termination, 6530 terminals
    will always will be left in conversational (ITI) mode.
    
    Formerly, control-12 would immediately terminate the session
    without any indication, with possible confusion that the session
    was still active but with slow response. Terminal emulators
    left in 6530 block (full screen) mode sometimes required
    various reset or unlock procedures to activate a new session.

541. [H01^AAH]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): Commands were missing to control timeouts for
    inactive terminals.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Inactive terminals can now be timed out and logged off. There
    are four related STNCOM commands.  The defaults are shown:
    
    INPUT_TIMOUT <minutes>        default 0
    BANNER_TIMEOUT <minutes>      default 0
    IDLE_WARNING <minutes>        default 3
    OUTPUT_RESET Y | N            default Y
    
    INPUT_TIMEOUT <timeout>
    
      INPUT_TIMEOUT logs off unattended terminals to enhance
      security.
    
      <timeout> is in minutes, range 3-14400 (3 minutes to 10 days),
      or 0 to disable. The timer is reset whenever input is received
      from the terminal.  If OUTPUT_RESET=Y (see below), the timer is
      also reset whenever application output is sent to the terminal.
      If there is no activity by the time the timer approaches within
      IDLE_WARNING minutes of INPUT_TIMEOUT, a warning message is
      displayed:
    
      STN35 **WARNING** Terminal will be disconnected if it stays
      idle...
    
      This message includes a bell and appears on Line 25 of 6530
      terminals and emulators. For other terminals, it is displayed
      as a regular text line. The message will repeat every minute
      until INPUT_TIMEOUT is reached, when the following message is
      displayed:
    
      STN36 Terminal was idle too long! Disconnecting...
    
      After another 10 seconds, the terminal is disconnected.
    
    BANNER_TIMEOUT <timeout>
    
      BANNER_TIMEOUT frees resources used by idle connections that
      never complete the service menu.
    
      <timeout> is in minutes, range 3-14400 (3 minutes to 10 days),
      or 0 to disable. BANNER_TIMEOUT applies while the service menu
      prompt "STN02 Enter Choice: " is displayed at the beginning of
      a session.
    
      BANNER_TIMEOUT is similar in all respects to INPUT_TIMEOUT, but
      applies only during the STN02 prompt.
    
      BANNER_TIMEOUT and INPUT_TIMEOUT can be used individually or in
      combination.
    
      For services with LOGON REQ, the STN15 and STN16 messages
      prompt for a userid and password. If either of these prompts
      is not answered within 60 seconds, the session is terminated
      with an STN54 error message.  This timeout always is in effect
      regardless of INPUT_TIMEOUT or BANNER_TIMEOUT.
    
    IDLE_WARNING <0 to 14400>
    
      Specifies the number of STN35 warnings (one per minute) to be
      displayed before the session is terminated by INPUT_TIMEOUT or
      BANNER_TIMEOUT. A value of zero (0) means no STN35 warnings
      will be displayed until the session is terminated with
      an STN36 message.
    
    OUTPUT_RESET <Y | N>
    
      Determines if INPUT_TIMEOUT applies to sessions that have
      ongoing output, even if there is no keyboard input. When
      OUTPUT_RESET=Y, any application output to a terminal resets the
      timer just as if input was received from the terminal. This
      means that a terminal that regularly updates the display, such
      as an EMS or console log, may never timeout. When
      OUTPUT_RESET=N, then INPUT_TIMEOUT applies even if output is
      being displayed, giving additional security.
    
    These commands have been added in STNCOM.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY):  A command was missing that allows the
    contents of an edit file to be displayed at session startup
    after STN46/STN47 and before the STN02 services menu.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    New STNCOM command WELCOME allows the contents of an edit file
    to be displayed at session startup after STN46/STN47 and before
    the STN02 Services menu.
    
        WELCOME OFF       turns off welcome

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): A command was missing that specifies a
    timeout at the beginning of the session while waiting for the
    application to first open the window.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    STNCOM command OPENER_WAIT was added to specify a timeout at the
    beginning of the session while waiting for the application to
    first open the window.
    
    OPENER_WAIT allows values from 1-300 (1 second to 5 minutes) and
    defaults to 30 (seconds). Note that AUTODEL_WAIT formerly 
    performed  this function, but has been changed as described
    in this softdoc. If no application opens the window, after
    OPENER_WAIT seconds, the screen will be erased (for 6530
    terminals) and the following message appears:
    
       STN38 No application program active on this terminal for nnn
       seconds.  Session terminated.
    
    This message will be displayed for several seconds, then the
    session will terminate.
    
    OPENER_WAIT now also applies to dynamic window sessions which
    previously had a fixed wait time of 60 seconds.  For this case
    the existing error message STN41 is used.

    STN no longer sends esc o (1b 6f) to non-6530 terminals as part
    of the STN46 and STN47 startup messages to the terminal.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (pseudo-TTY): The ADD SERVICE command was missing a 
    parameter "HOME" to start the dynamic process with the specified
    home terminal (typically $ZHOME).
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The new ADD SERVICE parameter HOME starts the dynamic process
    with the specified home terminal. The default home
    terminal is the name of the dynamic window being started
    ($STN.#ZWNxxxx). This fixes a problem with a dynamic service
    starting PATHCOM with PARAM set to "$PM;RUN <program>".
    While the Pathway program would run normally, if the session
    was terminated at the remote terminal, PATHCOM would abend and
    leave a ZZSAnnnn dump file, usually in subvol $SYSTEM.SYSTEM.
    Typical configuration:
    
              ADD SERVICE pathdyn,TYPE    DYNAMIC
                                 ,PROGRAM $system.system.pathcom

    terminated the session.
    (No SOLN)
   
575. [H01^AAG]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    TACL commands given in an exec request were ignored if the SSH 
    client allocated a PTY. For instance, executing
    "ssh -t user@nonstop tacl -c WHO" on a remote system did not
    invoke the WHO command.

576. [H01^AAG]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    Under certain timing conditions, exit status 0 was reported

577. [H01^AAG]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (Pseudo-TTY): Timestamps in trace files and GTRED displays 
    needed improvement. VPROCs for STNCOM and GTRED did not adhere
    to current date format rules.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    These problems were fixed in STN release A81. GFTLIB H29 was
    used to accomplish this.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (Pseudo-TTY): When Win6530 was running in OSS mode, vi
    command line editing was not working properly. When recalling
    a command with esc K, pressing "enter" would return to the
    command prompt without processing the command.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    STN (Pseudo-TTY): Posix signal characters, such as control-C,
    received when no Posix read was active, were not recognized.
    These characters are now recognized even when preceded by other
    input characters.  The problem was first diagnosed after
    interrupting a long "ls -lR /" display; typing another
    character before control-C would not generate a signal.

    code 101 (EDIT) were not accepted. These file types are now
    valid, allowing binary or ascii file transfers to the

    ADD/ALTER USER failed when specifying a Safeguard ALIAS
    name containing any uppercase letters as SYSTEM-USER.
    ADD/RENAME also downshifted the user name.
   
    FIX-INFO:

    SYMPTOMS: 
    SFTP[OSS] and SFTPSERV  employed an algorithm that 
    resulted in slow transfers into structured Guardian files.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    SFTP[OSS] and SFTPSERV now employ the same mechanism 
    as the FUP LOAD command for faster transfers into structured
    Guardian files.

590. [H01^AAE]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    The Guardian SSH and SFTP clients returned the remote exit
    status as condition code, which resulted in non-standard
    condition codes being returned.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    Now SSH and SFTP behave like OSH, returning a standard 
    condition code to report success or failure, while the remote
    exit status is returned as termination info.

    SYMPTOMS: 
    When STN (pseudo TTY terminal) was running in certain older
    Guardian releases, and the remote node was running newer
    Guardian releases, a cpu halt occurred after a remote OSS open.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    This has been fixed in STN release A80.
    (No SOLN)
   
596. [H01^AAE]
   
    SYMPTOMS: 
    The file LICENSE was used to control functionality of the
    product. When receiving a new LICENSE file to unlock 
    functionality, customers would replace the existing "dummy"
    license file on $system.zssh with the "full" license file.
     
    When upgrading to a later-version SUT or installing a 
    Time Critical Fix SPR related to NonStop SSH, DSM/SCM replaced
    the "full" license file with the original "dummy" license file
    which would then restrict product functionality.
   
    FIX-INFO: 
    The license file is no longer distributed, and consequently, the
    customer's license file will not be overwritten with a new
    installation. The pseudo TTY process will start without a license
    file (previously, it terminated).

Known Problems Remaining:

 1. SYMPTOMS: 
    The download of EDIT files fails.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Some SFTP clients (for instance Tectia) rely on receiving the 
    exact size of the file to be transferred at the start of the
    file transfer and "hang" if that size is not correct.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Low.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Convert the EDIT file to an UNSTRUCTURED file before the 
    transfer.
    (No SOLN)
   
 2. SYMPTOMS: 
    After receiving a new license file the SSH process does not start
    and abends with the following error message: 
    Unexpected exception during initialization:
    DefaultDecryptor: cannot decrypt message with this passphrase ..
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    As documented in the Reference Manual, the key store is stored
    in a single ENSCRIBE file. In order to prevent unauthorized 
    access to the user database, it is stored in a proprietary 
    format and encrypted. The CUSTOMER entry within the license
    file for the SSH2 program is used as input for the user database.
    When you plan to duplicate the user database onto other NonStop
    systems (such as a disaster recovery system), or if you replace
    a license file, you need to make sure to use the same entry
    for CUSTOMER. Otherwise, the key store cannot be opened during
    startup and the error message appears.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    There are two possible solutions: 
    
    If you still know the 'original' value of CUSTOMER in the 'old'
    license file, you can have HP create a new license file with
    the same value for CUSTOMER.
    
    To override the value in the license file with the known and
    proper one, add a parameter CUSTOMER with the proper value
    to the configuration.

 3. SYMPTOMS: 
    The STN ADD SERVICE LIMIT parameter has no effect under certain
    conditions.
   
    CONDITIONS:

    sessions are started and then the userid/password prompts are
    answered.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Unlikely.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    Completely start sessions for any given resilient service one at 
    a time.
    (No SOLN)
   
 4. SYMPTOMS: 
    A place-holder license file is no longer distributed with an
    SSH installation, starting with release H06.14 (SSH SPR
    T0801^AAE). As a result, when a customer upgrades the OS on the 
    system from H06.13 to a more recent release, and the DSMSCM 
    utility ZPHIRNM is run, the SSH license file is renamed in the
    SSH installation subvolume, which causes an error after the
    system is restarted. Without the license, SSH processes will 
    start but refuse connections.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    Upgrading the system from H06.13.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Unlikely.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    The problem can be solved by stopping the SSH processes,
    renaming the license file back to LICENSE, then restarting SSH.

 5. SYMPTOMS: 
    The OSM Service Connection would take a minute or more to 
    complete its initial system discovery process.
   
    IMPACT: 
    This problem only occurs with TCF T0801H01^ACE.  It has been 
    corrected in subsequent releases and therefore does not exist 
    in any other releases either before or after T0801H01^ACE.
   
    CONDITIONS: 
    SSH in SSHAPI/SSHLIB mode would incur a delay due to a protocol 
    adaptation made in SSH2.  The delay is proportional to the number
    of CLIMs in the system.
    
    PLEASE NOTE: 
    OSM for L-series systems does not use the SSHLIB and therefore
    this problem will not occur on L-series systems.
   
    LIKELIHOOD: 
    Always.
   
    WORKAROUNDS: 
    None.
   
    SIDE-EFFECTS: 
    SSH in SSHAPI/SSHLIB mode would incur a delay due to a protocol 
    adaptation made in SSH2.  The delay is proportional to the number
    of CLIMs in the system.
